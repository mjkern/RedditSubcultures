1,e1ewz6,boersc,1574682161.0,3,The Unicorn Princess - Review,"The Unicorn Princess by Big Ben and Toplitz productions was released on November 14th 2019 on  PC (Steam), Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

Here's the trailer of the game:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDY1rCD4uBc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDY1rCD4uBc)

This game sees you as Leila, a young girl, who loves riding her horse. One day, she gets called by a strange voice, which turns out to belong to a unicorn from the Dream World. Leila has to help the Unicorn to save the Dream World by helping out the Guardian. She can help by performing good deeds in the real world, and then perform a specific task in the Dream World. 

The good deeds vary between fetch quest, cleaning garbage piles (by riding your horse over them), or delivering goods. the DreamWorld tasks range from running obstacle courses, where you have to collect rings, to finding a specific object (shield, helmet  or sword). There is no time-pressure on any of these tasks, so anyone can complete them at their own pace. It is difficult to actually fail a task, but if you do that, you can easily re-try the task as many times as you want/need.

The game takes place in a wide open world, that looks pretty decent, with quite some variety. If you don't want to progress the story, you can simply ride your horse all over the area, which is decently large, providing room enough to explore, while being small enough to not get lost. There are rivers, ponds, hills and open areas, and almost everything is accessible. You can wade through rivers, and will be slowed down, but you will not get blocked.

Quite a few games have very difficult controls, but the controls in The Unicorn Princess are very easy to use, also for younger kids. Some games use tank-controls, which is very annoying for kids), but controls here are very intuitive. The left stick lets you maneuver the horse, while the <L1/R1> buttons (on PS4) control speed.

Pacing is good. There are some 15 chapters, and each one can be completed in about 10-15 minutes maximum. There is only one chapter which is kind of boring, in which you are expected to bring a cart of soda to a remote location and back. The cart rides at a snail-pace, AND you have to go all the way back with it too.

I encountered a few small technical issues, where Leila would get placed almost next to her horse, but this only occurred when I tried to climb a mountain that was clearly too steep (on the edge of the map, so it was not meant to be scaled).

When you are done with the story, you can collect miniature unicorn figurines which are scattered around the map, purchase clothings and different horses, which you can of course ride and groom. 

Grooming the horse is often a bit of a pain, but here it is pretty short and easy to do. Grooming your horse regularly ensures his performance, speed and ability to jump, so from time to time, grooming is a necessity.

All in all, The Unicorn Princess is a very decent horse-game, which should appeal to kids of the target age (6-10). It is accessible and easy to control, making it one of the better horse-games out there.

&#x200B;

I'm designing a game set in the Old West, and would like some advice on horse travel speed. Looking online, I can only really find things like ""top speeds of horses"" and such. I don't really want to know that - I want to know what is a REALISTIC distance you could ride a horse without it keeling over and dying or seriously injuring itself.

&#x200B;

As of right now, my game states that you can ride a horse at most 36 miles in a single day without it becoming exhausted. If you push your horse to the point it gets really tired, it can travel 8 miles in a single hour.

&#x200B;

I know the top speed of a horse is WAY faster than than, but to my understanding a horse cannot really travel ""top speed"" for very long without hurting itself or becoming extremely tired. Additionally, modern races and relays also come with modern care and medicine. I want to know; are my estimations reasonable or way off? Is it foolish to think a horse could travel 36 miles in a day and be fine, or is it a crazy under-estimation to assume one could only manage 8 miles in an hour?",GamesWithHorses

I've wanted good horse games for years and was always disappointed with what's out there so I finally decided to take matters into my own hands. 

These days, I'm working on a [horse game inspired by Stardew Valley](http://aliceruppert.ch/horsegame.html) and I'm running a blog/website called [The Mane Quest](https://www.themanequest.com/) where I write news, reviews, analyses and developer interviews about horses in video games. 

The idea for this subreddit came up on the Horses and Video Games discord, [which you can join here](https://discord.gg/6v96y2f).
