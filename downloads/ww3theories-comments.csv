If we are constantly snooping where we shouldn't be that will definitely make it much easier even with our own defences since I like to think the navy is our first line of defence if we were ever to be attacked. Makes me think a little bit. And with NK having a new gen of short range and long range missiles then that turns the tide. And Putin rebuilding and reusing cold war era bunkers in Cuba."
