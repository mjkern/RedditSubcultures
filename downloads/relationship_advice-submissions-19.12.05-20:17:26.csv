0,e6qz03,Helpneededlol,1575594027.0,1,F20 I went out with mister police man,"Hey guys. 

I wrote here some days ago, about that cop that came to my apartment without a reason, and proceeded to get sexual, which turned out with us having sex and not even really having a conversation after. This whole thing left a strange feeling in me, but it didn’t end here. 

Yesterday i was going back to my place and i found him waiting for me (not in his uniform) in front of my door. 
He was really polite and just nice in general but also very flirty. I was of course a little surprised because I didn’t expect to find him here. 

He said that he wanted to invite me out, and I accepted. We went for a drink and for a walk, and it was great. 

Of course we talked about what happened even tho i felt awkward, i asked him if it’s something he always does, he said it’s his second time and he only did that because he felt like we had a connection. But i idk what to think about it. He also said he wouldn’t have forced me if I didn’t want to. He asked me if i really liked it etc and i told him yeah but also i felt confused & strange afterwards. 

We kissed a lot of times while out and i felt good but then when i came back home I started feeling uncomfortable. 

I feel like i am infatuated with this guy, or maybe I already like him, and this makes me feel weird. 
Like, he did something wrong, and we’re not talking about ‘kids’ stuff. Is something serious and he could be a rapist/predator/offender, I don’t know. Even if he says it’s his second time I don’t know him I cannot know if he is telling the truth. 

What i CAN say is that i got a good impression but then again i am not affidabile seen that i may like him so my brain could be giving me wrong signals. 

Also he’s 26 years old and i am 20, it’s not a huge difference but he is so much more mature than me and like has already a job and everything, so much experience, whereas i am just out of high school and I don’t even know what i am going to do next lol. 



He wants to keep seeing me and we already planned to go out tomorrow and i also can’t wait to see him again but then again...
I don’t know if I should keep going or not. The uncomfortableness is present and it makes me feel weird but at the same time i feel like a 13teen year old at her first crush. I keep obsessing over him in a dumb way lol

Wondering if it’s even worth fighting over and trying for a relationship with her,"My husband and I have been together 9 years, married almost two. We live far away from both of our families/parents. I met my MIL once, when we had been dating 6 months and didn’t meet/see her again until 6 months after we eloped. 

Right off the bat, the first time she met, she had a lot of words to say to me when I opened my car door and she realized I smoked cigarettes. Told me her son has asthma even though he has smoked the entire time over known him.

Cut to us eloping, I called my parents to tell them what we were doing and they were thrilled. (They adore husband and have been on several vacations with him and I.) she immediately asks him “not to do it, just because I’m pregnant”.  I’m not fucking pregnant. We just wanna get married.

We see eachother one more time for a decent holiday. All seems well.

My husband went out to his home state to see her without me because I couldn’t get off work. She apparently spends the next 4 days talking trash about me and our sham of a marriage.

He didn’t tell me about any of it until this week, and it’s been months. I’m not even really mad because I know she doesn’t like me and it just pissed me TF off. I’ve invited her to several holidays over the years with my parents and she always declines.

Biggest reason she doesn’t like me is we both drink too much. We are heavier then we should be (I get it..) but she’s somehow an unemployed active lady, taking trips around the world, and she dislikes we don’t do those same things. (We live in an expensive city)

Husband just tells me to blow it off, that when she said shit about me, he shut it down. But she keeps slipping him divorce lawyer talk and thinks we should go to counseling????

3,e6qy1e,egosumek,1575593909.0,1,My girlfriend doesn’t care that my dog died,"So this just happened and I still don’t know how to process it all. 

Some context: I’m attending university outside of my home country. My dog, who is in my home country under the care of my aunt, died 3 days ago. This was obviously heartbreaking for me because I didn’t have the chance to be with him, or say goodbye. But I kept it to myself and didn’t tell my girlfriend (explained why below). 

My girlfriend and I are in our second year of university, and it’s finals season. My girlfriend had an exam yesterday and was feeling pretty unprepared (because she had a final the day before too) - this is why I didn’t tell her about my dog. I didn’t want her to feel sad and not be able to study. On top of that, she had a stomachache, and so she decided to go to the hospital at 1am with her friend. I live around 15 kilometres from her place and was studying for my own exam that’s in 2 days. She texted me from the hospital saying that she’s waiting for the blood tests to come through and that her phone was about to die, and she gave me her friends number in case I needed to contact her. I didn’t really think it was a big deal that she’s at the hospital because it was just a stomachache, and I knew that part of the reason she went is so she could get a doctors note and skip her exam. So I carried on with my studying, texted her that I’m going to bed, and that I hope everything goes well, and sleep. She texted me at around 9am that she’s home, and that she’s  tired and is going to go to sleep. Okay, cool. I text her when I wake up and see her messages, saying that she should sleep and get something to eat, if she needs something blah blah blah. I call her when she wakes up, check up on her, ask her how she is - the general stuff. I keep FaceTiming her every few hours just to check up on her, I help her write an email to send to her prof etc. 

The whole day goes like this, everything seems normal. Then, right before she goes to bed, she tells me how she’s hurt that I didn’t come to her place, give her food, and take care of her. Out of nowhere. She acts fine the entire day then says this before sleeping. Instead of being defensive I tell her that I’m sorry she feels that way, and I’m sorry that it seemed as if I didn’t care (even though I did). I even said that I was studying for my final (I’m in mechanical engineering so it’s been pretty tough), and hence couldn’t come all the way to her place. She wasn’t taking any of it. She kept scoffing at me, saying I didn’t care etc. Then, I finally broke and told her that my dog passed away and it’s been difficult for me the past few days. Part of the reason it seemed like I didn’t show enough empathy was because I was grieving, and that I’m sorry I didn’t tell her about it before. The first thing she says after saying “Awh poor puppy”, was “yeah but that still doesn’t change what you did”. With. Fucking. Attitude. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I just told you my dog fucking died and this is what you say? Jesus Christ. I was fuming but I didn’t retaliate, I just stared at her in shock. We went back and forth, I kept on apologizing, and she kept saying that it’s a dog and not a human and other nonsense like that. At the end, we just hung up and slept. 
I called her this morning to wake her up and ask her how she’s feeling, and to apologize (yeah, apologize again) for whatever happened. She was having none of it. At the end she said that she doesn’t care about me, nor my exam. “I’ll treat you how you treated me” were her exact words. Wtf? I was so nice to her and I kept calling her to check up on her, and she spews this shit at me? 

Whatever, a few hours later we talk again and it’s the same shit all over again. She keeps saying she doesn’t care about me, when I tell her I love her she doesn’t say it back. She just says she doesn’t care. More than anything, she seems to be devoid of any empathy towards the death of my dog, even though she knows how much he meant to me. Honestly, I’m just fucking hurt.

im just gonna go straight to my issue, I’ve had some anger issues with my girlfriend and i’ve had done things i do regret as like raising my voice, lashing out and saying things i dont mean and we both came to the conclusion that i’ve been verbally abusive. I own up to that and its been months that ive noticed i havent had an episode for a while which im proud of and recently i did it again and im very embarrassed by it. My girlfriend is such an amazing woman and she doesn’t deserve it all and knowing that has put me in a bad depression and since then ive been doing things i have never done in my life such as talking about my feelings and looking for help. I really feel doing those things will really help me out with my anger because i would always bottle up everything and i would never talk about my feelings because of my ego and pride. Doing all that i feel is very healthy and good towards my mental health. But i cant let go of the guilt and its been eating at me lately and its made me go into bad moods and often really sad when im around her.

I knew this, stupidly caught feelings anyway, and I guess I stared/glanced at her too often. And in turn, I guess she stared at me too, and it just got really awkward. I allowed myself to think I had a chance, even though almost every other sentence about her day was about what her fiance and her did, or a comment about him. I should've taken a hint, or just realized I didn't have a chance. I still think she felt something at some point, based on some very odd things that have happened, but nothing to the point where she doubted her fiance's relationship. (I know this is pitiful to say, and it's embarrassing to type)

So I acted a bit immature, was a bit cold and awkward to her. I just wanted to distance myself emotionally, and I honestly think I came off as a jerk. I completely avoided her one day and she looked miserable, people kept asking her what was wrong, and she pretty much said this was her worst workday ever despite her having the most relaxed shift of us all.

I finally got a hold of myself, and started acting friendly again. And we click as we did before, and it's honestly pretty nice. It takes a conscientious effort to stop myself from putting some false hope in my head, but when she is recently telling me about vacation plans for her boyfriend and her, it's not too hard to ground myself.

My only problem now, is that she still hasn't stopped staring/glancing. She will even check to see if I'm looking at her, and I only notice this when I'm talking to someone else and she constantly looks over at me. She gets upset/restless if I don't acknowledge her. It's so confusing to me. I figured she would stop and be happy this weird dude at work finally got over his stupid crush. But her failure to return to normalcy is ruining it all. I'm tempted to just avoid her entirely again if this persists.

How do I get her to stop staring at me? And stop glancing if I look in her direction? Why won't she just accept that I'm ""over"" her? Do I just go no-contact and only professional conversations from now on?

tl;dr Crushed on taken coworker, she had to have known because relationship got weird. Now I'm trying to act normal and treat her like the rest, and she still stares/glances and looks for my attention",relationship_advice

Many of my friends and dudes I personally know would probably love to have the problem I have. But I’m just not that type of guy. Growing up I never got that much attention from females. That all changed once I graduated high school and turned 18.

Since I’ve turned 18 it’s not hard for me to get girls to go on dates with me, but it’s extremely hard to get a girl I’m really into to make things official and be my girlfriend. I’ve gone on plenty of dates, was in the “talking” phase with a lot of girls and have had my fair share of casual hookups but all of that is so exhausting to me. I’ve only ever actually been in one relationship that lasted for a few years and ended with her cheating on me multiple times with multiple people. It’s hard for me to find women that really match my energy and that I really would like to pursue something that’s not casual with. When I do find those types of girls it feels like I’m just fighting an uphill battle to try and get them to want something that isn’t casual from me. 

I don’t consider myself that attractive at all I’m like a high 6 maybe low 7 and I feel like almost every girl I’ve taken out was much better looking than me. However, I’m a really funny guy, have a unique fashion/style sense, I’m very confident with myself, can hold a conversation, a great communicator and have a lot of interesting and unique hobbies and interests that I’m very passionate about. So naturally when I meet a girl that shares lots of the same interests as me it’s a rare occurrence and it usually makes them that much more attractive to me. I just met this girl that I am really into and I just don’t wanna let another one slip away lol. 

Last weekend I was in town visiting my family for the holidays, I took this girl on a date early afternoon and I had more fun than I’ve had in a really long time. She was very quirky and funny, very beautiful, shared lots of the same interests as me, and we did our whole date on the fly I would pick one thing to do then she would pick one thing and vice versa. We were both laughing and flirting with eachother the whole time and hung out all day and she even liked me so much she took me to meet her parents (not typical for a first date but I was really into her), her parents and I clicked almost instantly cause we share the same occupational field. The next day her and I hung out again all night I greeted her with a bouquet of her favorite flowers which she really liked then we went to my parents house and we just stayed up all night in the spare bedroom and had a very deep conversation in which I shared with her a lot of personal things I haven’t told many people and she did the same. 

The night ended with us having some pretty passionate sex and then I took her home really early in the morning. We sat and talked in the driveway for like half an hour and we both agreed that we would like to continue seeing eachother and keep talking with the ultimate goal of it leading to something serious. I live out of state due to work however I come home at least once every 2 months and told her I wouldn’t be opposed to her visiting me if it lead to something serious or coming home more often to see her since I have the time to do it (girls in the area I’m in are really not my type at all I hate where I currently live). She’s not the greatest at texting and I know that but the thing that concerns me is she doesn’t text me that much or talk to me that much through the day since I left and she actually hasn’t responded to anything today. I know she’s currently on a trip to LA with her friends until the 8th so maybe I should just give her some spaces and stop overthinking it and see what’s up afterwards but still.

16,e6qn0g,bestorangecarrot,1575592637.0,1,a girl who really likes my boyfriend is really close to him- and she's talking shit about me behind my back,"(This is my first post, sorry for any mistakes and sorry if I broke any unspoken rules)

So this situation is a little complicated.

There's background necessary for this situation: I (should i include my age? if so its 15) started liking my boyfriend (also 15, lets call him A) around a month and a half ago. Around a couple weeks later, my friend (lets call her B) starts liking A too, but she tells me she was rejected. A short while after that, A tells me he likes me and we start dating. (I would like to clarify that B truly had no chance, and that I specifically asked her for permission.)

We tried our best to be sensitive to her feelings, but she was naturally hurt. She starts telling a lot of people everything about the situation, which made me uncomfortable but I let her be because I could sympathize with her situation. She's still acting like my best friend in the meanwhile.

Here's the thing: A and B are really close. Like, really close. He stays up late to listen to her problems and interacts more with her than me. I wasn't about to ask them to stop being friends, because that's not my place, but I was still uncomfortable and I told my friend as such. However, it ended up getting back to A and B, and B texted me that she was sorry but A said nothing about it. 

I start hearing from various people (by various I mean almost everyone in our mutual friend group) that B's telling people that A and B were going to be a thing if not for me, and calling me a bitch even though she's super sweet to my face. A is texting me about B's feelings and how he feels bad for her, and although it's understandable I'm started to feel a little annoyed and a little hurt.

B then begins telling A that she's going to kill herself. And one night she texts him that she's gonna go kill herself.

He freaks out, as one does when a friend threatens suicide, and texts her sister to stop her. It's a whole thing, and I'm super concerned for B. But then it comes out that she's faking it. She tells a friend that she's just playing to see how much he cares, and if he really cared that much, why isn't A dating B instead of me? Concerned friends begin to tell me more and more about her calling me fat and ugly, saying that A should be dating her, and her bitching about plans she made with me. A didn't and does not know about any of this.

This is when I begin to stop talking to her, because even before this whole thing about A she's been a bad friend. I'm not dramatic about it; I just stop seeking her out and squealing with her over inane things. A begins to text me about it, telling me that B's really hurt and implying that my choice of friends is wrong because B dislikes one of my closest friends. I'm just fed up at this point, and I ask A to stop talking to me about B.

And it felt like that's it. But today I was playing around on A's snapchat and I accidentally opened his conversation with B. I feel really bad and weirdly possessive for invading his privacy, but I saw my name and I was too curious not to read. It was essentially B telling A that I was jealous and mad at her, and that I would probably ask A to stop talking to her soon. A assured her that I had no right to control who he was friends with, and that hurt. He's right, but it's a little sad to know that he's talking to her about the situation and listening to her problems with our relationship when he barely talks to me about anything of substance. I kept reading, and they stay up every night so he can basically be her personal therapist, while he only ever talks to me about memes and really surface level conversations.

What should I do? I'm honestly considering breaking up with him because a 2 week relationship isn't worth this kind of drama, but I really enjoy dating A, drama aside. I don't know if I should confront him or not. Do I tell him about what B's been saying? Because I don't want to be that one jealous girlfriend, and I don't want to play into B's need for drama.

His family came up for a week and he had me hanging out with them and him. It was amazing, they are from around where I’m from so they made me feel more at home than my parents ever did. And one night we are laying in bed just talking and I made him realize he’s not as okay as he thought he was with the divorce going on and him loving her deeply. I started this out knowing that there wouldn’t be a relationship because he told me so. After this he got super distant so I told him to think out his thoughts and get back with me. A week later he messages me saying he wants to see where it goes. Perfect. But from time to time he gets distant and pushes me away, I know it’s because he’s having a hard time with the divorce and is wary of getting in another relationship, but he keeps me around for some reason. I finally told him he can’t fuck with my feelings and that he needs to further think out his thoughts. Because I compliment him all the time, call him handsome, pay for food, help him clean house, but I don’t get the “you’re beautiful” from when we first started hanging out, he hardly gives me the time of day, and for some reason I can’t get him out of my head. My brain knows it’s because he’s going through a hard time but my heart is refusing to understand. 


Summary, he’s having a hard time with his divorce and says he wants to try a relationship, but he keeps pushing me away which hurts me. And I can’t get him off my mind.

It does not feel as if we are in a relationship. I feel left out of her life, and I can't figure out why she's doing this. We are both independent people so at first it didn't bother me when I wouldn't hear from her for a few days, but she goes a week without calling or visiting me and by this point, I'm ready to call it quits if nothing changes because obviously she isn't interested in me or my company.   
On the rare occasions that she does spend time with me, she's tired and basically just wants to go to bed after dinner. I understand that her work is stressful as she just started at a new company, but I literally feel as if she's making up excuses to stay home and sleep.   
Just yesterday, it took her 2 hours longer to show up for dinner and all she offered as an apology was that she could not find a parking spot. When I told her I did not believe her, she was visibly upset and asked me to let it go. However, that becomes increasingly hard. I'm not sure if I can trust her anymore. And I don't feel like her boyfriend, more like a casual acquaintance.

Do I need to count my losses and move on? I feel played. She keeps telling me that it'll get better and that she loves me. But I just don't see that reflected in her actions, as much as it pains me to admit that.",relationship_advice

We’ve been doing all the typical date things, going for drinks/food/film nights etc, and we get on so we’ll, feelings are starting to develop and recently we’ve begun being sexual. 

The issue for me is, she’s very, very closed minded, and describes herself as “Vanilla”.

(Not saying there is anything wrong with that, but I’ve been very adventurous with sex in the past and have always imagined my ideal partner as somebody who at the very least is open minded to trying things).

She’s a very “straight laced”, hard working studious girl, who never puts a foot wrong, but she’s very also very limited in her life experiences. By this I mean she’s never travelled, hasn’t tried many types of food, never does anything “crazy” or “new”, and these traits seem to carry over into her sexual preferences.

I joke to her about how I’ll help her “broaden her horizons” in terms of things like the travel and the food etc, and she seems really up for it, but whenever I crack jokes about anything sexual that isn’t straight up standard sex, she dismisses it quite clearly.

This could be a dealbreaker for me, but I’m not sure whether to stick with it and hope she opens her mind over time, or if I’ll just end up catching feelings for somebody that won’t ever make me truly happy.

She beautiful, charming, cute, a social butterfly, she's lovely in a lot of ways. 

But, she has issues... or I do, I'm unclear on that and I hope to find the answer here whether by writing it down, or having your opinions. 

She's someone who deals with anxiety and a massive amount of stress regarding every aspect of her life, except maybe socially. Now I'm trying to be accommodating, removing some weight from her shoulder by either giving her a hand with her weekly cleaning since we don't live together. Going to bed early to help her get some rest, cooking diner while she does her daily chores (she live alone with her lovely cat Gustave). Anyway I try to help where I can to lighten her duties outside of work. 

She's been having a rough few weeks and earlier today she came at in an ""attacking"" manner because I didn't clean her dishes properly, now I could understand under some circumstances , like if it was a repeated offence or those were my dishes. When I told her how I felt about being treated that way when all I'm trying to do is help her, she told me that it seemed like I didn't care about how she felt. But I think the issue is not that she shared how she felt, but way she did it. It made me feel inadequate, it made me feel like I was worthless. Is it me being hard on myself, or is this a bigger issue. That one of the places where I'd need your feedback. 

Now onto me because : hey why the fuck not. I'm someone who always try to be my best in the areas of my life that matter the most to me and why my current SO, I feel like my best is not enough, that my efforts aren't recognized. Is this normal ? I've practically had 1 relationship before and I can't really use this as a comparative. 

I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. 

The other part that is bugging me is a bit controversial in my mind. But basically, we both have nice apartments, 15 minutes from each other by car. Usually, we sleep 2 days a week at my place and the rest at hers. She shared that being at my place twice a week is exhausting for, which, again I understand. So we moved it onto once a week, on Wednesdays. Here's the things, I don't know if it's due to her being so tired and overwhelmed the past few weeks, but everytime she has flaked out of it and to be honest if I'm paying 1k in rent a month, I'd kinda like to be at my place from time to time, especially with her. I want to share things that makes me happy with her and I always feel my [puppy](https://i.imgur.com/mAlmPQU.jpg) bring her happiness.

 I always try to make her as happy as possible, but I feel like it's never enough. Or that my small mistake undo all the positive I'm putting in her life. I feel inadequate, I feel anxiety because, yes here I've mostly spoken about what's negative, or questionable, but she has so much more than those things to offer and I'm conflicted about the whole thing. 

I don't know if I'm asking a question, an opinion or if I'm just putting my emotions out there, but thank you for reading this, it has helped me , kinda.

28,e6qfnp,roxypotter13,1575591722.0,2,I [F26] am in a long distance relationship with my bf [M21]. He’s wonderful but I feel like somethings missing and am not sure what to do.,"TLDR: had an ex with intense love. Ended after 2 years of on and off. With an amazing guy and can’t tell if it’s just the distance or if we’re just not right for each other or if my past is preventing me from seeing clearly. 

I met my ex when I was 21 and he was 20. The first year was amazing- fireworks. Knew we wanted to marry each other. Our second year we fell into a rut and then a bunch of stressful things happened in our lives that caused us to fight. He broke up with me because he didn’t want to be married and fighting. We got back together two more times before I initiated the last break up, knowing he didn’t want to keep trying. 

I was single for a year and struggled to find anyone starting a biomedical PhD program. Then I met my current bf at a music festival. He was young and sweet. I didn’t intend to keep him around- but we kept talking and got along. I felt lonely in the Phd program and after all my friends leaving with my ex. I probably wouldn’t have started dating him if I wasn’t in the PhD program and knew my options were limited and the city I live in is small. 

My life spiraled downward as school became hellish, but he stayed supportive. He wasn’t particularly helpful with my stress- he didn’t really know how to calm me down. But he cared and I did appreciate that. It was hard to have love or positive emotion at all during that time. And so when I quit the PhD program in the summer, I still felt pretty emotionally dead. I got a job as a personal trainer, started a masters in business program. Fast forward a month- my life is much happier. I have a good support system. But I feel uncertain about my bf. 

When we’re together, he’s very affectionate. His parents love me. He makes me feel loved and cared for, which was more than my ex did. Yet I felt so certain about my ex. We had this intense chemistry and love between us. My current boyfriend is more stable and calm. More comforting. But I feel like I’m missing that.. in love part. I appreciate him so much as a person. He’s silly and we love the same things. He’s patient and cares a lot. He does have an issue with jealousy, which is worse cause of the distance. But when I set boundaries on that he accepts them (even if begrudgingly) and does try to improve himself.

When we’re together I feel content. But even two weeks apart, I start questioning if I really want to be with him. I love being in a relationship with him. But I don’t know if I want to marry him. This feels like a big issue because my current plan is to move out there next summer. That’s another year and a half of waiting to see if we work together in person. I love his family, and I love how well he takes care of me. I want to be excited about the prospect of being with him because on paper it’s so perfect. I really want to get out of my city too and I’m afraid that if we’re not together I will be too afraid or too poor to move there on my own. And I want to give him a chance as well.

But still, I keep questioning. I feel like there’s some issues with attraction but I can’t tell if that’s just me or partially because he’s lost confidence since he lost weight from being sick and hasn’t gained his muscle back. I was less attracted to him when we first met, but it increased with the beard. And then fell a bit when he grew his hair really long and then when he lost weight. Then he cut his hair and it increased and decreased with his hair long. But I feel like that’s such a shallow reason not to be with someone. But maybe he deserves someone to be certain of him and feeling attracted to him with a wider margin than I do? I feel like I didn’t have such strict margin of attraction for my ex. 

I feel attracted to other guys. And while I’d never cheat on him and would leave him if I felt like I would- I hate that I feel this temptation to be with other guys. My job now is so much more social and I have more opportunities to meet people. I can’t tell if me wanting other people is me just feeling lonely from the distance or is a reflection of us not being right for each other. 

His jealousy also makes him want to be a little controlling sometimes, but I have good boundaries about that. When he said he didn’t want my ex to say hi and give me a hug, I told him his feelings were valid but that it should be ok for an old friend to hug me and for him to be around briefly as long as he was being polite. 


Am I settling by being with him? Or am I avoiding a stable good relationship because so have grass is greener syndrome and am attracted to toxicity from my past? I don’t want to dump a good thing for bad reasons. I thought at 30 I’d have married. I’m turning 27 and feels like my times running out lol. I don’t want to lose what I have with him- he’s so wonderful and so is his family. And I want to give him a chance in person. But I’m afraid of wasting a year and a half of my life.

And I just want to do right by him too. I want to feel more sure about him. I want to just be in love and be certain and make him feel as loved as he makes me feel. And I don’t want to stay with him if I discover that maybe I deserve to be with someone who I’m certain about and he deserves to be with someone who’s certain about him.

29,e6qffc,youngilliterate,1575591693.0,2,"My boyfriend might relocate in 6 months, and I’m really struggling with it","Hey guys. I’m having a rough time right now and could use some advice.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 months. He’s in a program at his work where in 6 months, he will either be relocated to a different state (or country) or will be able to stay where he is now. Either is possible, but it’s expected that he relocates. He also doesn’t have a choice as to whether or not he leaves, nor where he goes. 

He’ll find out in 4 months if he has to leave. Basically our game plan right now is that if he finds out that he does have to leave (and it’s somewhere that I’d be willing to move to), I’ll move in with him for those 2 months. If it works and we can live together, I’ll move with him. If it doesn’t, then we go our separate ways knowing that it wasn’t going to work.

However, there are a few issues:

1) I’m still in school and struggling with money, which could make transferring difficult.

2) He has broken up with all his past girlfriends because he didn’t want to do a LDR.

My problem is that I don’t know if living together for 2 months is enough time to figure out if I can drop everything and move with him to who knows where. Maybe I should move in earlier to help make the decision easier? But we’ve also only been together for 2 months. Albeit, I spend 4-5 nights a week with him, have met his family, traveled out of state to see his hometown and meet his childhood best friends, but still.... is moving in together this quickly a bad idea? We get along so very well and we’ve crossed a few milestones that most other people don’t after only 2 months. I’m just so worried that I could lose him over us moving too quickly. We both agreed that we want to be together, so maybe I just need to suck it up and understand that this is our situation? I don’t know. 

Should I move in earlier than planned? Stick to the plan? Not move in at all? Any advice you guys could offer would be greatly appreciated. I can’t stop thinking about the fact that my relationship is basically a countdown to a breakup.",relationship_advice

Back in early September, he asked me to be partners on this class project so we met and worked on it. He and I hooked up that night but continued to meet up and work on the project. We’d also hook up occasionally on the weekends without working on homework or anything. This whole time he’s been waiting for me after class (we have class together five days a week) to walk from class with me everyday. On days I’ve forgotten, he’s sent me a sad text message. 

Now, I realize most of that sounds like typical FWB behavior, but the past month has been different. We’ve continued meeting to work on our project, but once we work on the project for a little bit we’ve been watching movies and grabbing dinner. He’s been having me come over to his place way more than usual lately, and most of the times we hang out we aren’t even hooking up. We’ve been watching romantic movies, cuddling and drinking wine, and hanging out on the couch for hours. We’re still hooking up some but it doesn’t seem to be the focus now. Some nights we don’t even work on the project and we just watch movies and chill together. We spend hours talking about our lives and his parents know about me and have met me (we are on a small campus and met by accident but it was evident he had told his mom about me). 

Recently, too, he switched his spring schedule for me. He asked me which classes I was taking so that we could take more classes together and moved around his schedule so that we have three together. He also decided to go into the same masters program as me next year (we both graduate this year but are staying an extra year at our university for our own reasons) even though it doesn’t pertain to his major. He’s now making plans with me to take summer courses with me for the program and asked me to meet with the person who runs the masters program with him. 

He still jokes around about other girls and about other guys for me, but seems to be spending every evening with me. (We’ve hung out the past four nights in a row). 

Overall, what definitely started as a hookup seems to be changing into something new, but I’m not sure what that is or how to proceed.

33,e6qemu,VeryApplicableName,1575591593.0,1,I (22M) miss my friend. Should I try to be with her(21F)?,"Hi, throwaway because this is too personal.

Quick backstory, I was at university for a little while and during my time there, I happened to meet this girl. I saw her and immediately knew that I wanted to talk to her. She may not have been the hottest girl in the room but she was the most beautiful (I don't know what that means but it seems right). I digress. So, I made an excuse to talk, and we became really good friends (I still consider her one of my best friends).

Time goes on, I realize, 'oh boy, I think I love this girl'. I end up moving universities and can no longer see her. I tell her how I feel. She feels the same. Great, but not quite.

Gets complicated; I'm religious and it gets in the way. She isn't ready to get married, neither am I, but we can't date. We talk like we used to but our friendship is ablaze. We're in love or very close to it. 

Things get worse. She can't do this long distance thing and the no dating. We agree that our timing was awful. Right time, wrong place kinda thing. She feels distant. On good terms, we stop talking.

It shakes me to the core. I question everything; religion, work, family, everything. It takes me nearly a year to feel normal again. I miss her every day. I try to contact her but she ignores me.  I hate how desperate I seem and it makes me feel depressed because I cant control my emotions. Being unsure as to whether she's okay, whether she hates me, whether she even thinks about me at all, bothers me.

Another year passes. I haven't felt so much as a crush since then but I haven't been caught up over her. Certain things remind me of her; the beach, pastel pink, the smell of fresh linen. Yet, I am long over her in that I don't hurt when I think about her. Her name just makes me smile and I'm grateful for the time we had together. I think back and just feel content. 

Now, this is where I currently stand. She contacted me to find out how I've been. We're both alright but we didn't talk much. 

I've been fine with the idea that she may never come back. I understand that everyone's life is their own and I cannot own her or force her to be with me and that's okay. I'm still not in a place, financially, where I could pursue a marriage and I do still think I'm too young. Now my question is, what do I do? I'd like to talk to her again and become close again but it may just end like it did before. Additionally, on the other hand, I may regret not trying at all. I don't know if I believe in 'the one' but I haven't met anyone like her since. 

So, friends, do I talk to her and perhaps try to be with her again? Or, do I just leave it in the past?

I know at the end of the day, life finds a way. I'll be happy either way. But I'll be honest, she still holds a piece of my heart.",relationship_advice
34,e6qelz,THROWRA_mrniceguy,1575591589.0,1,My (F22) boyfriend (M27) is mostly interested in going to sex clubs for date night,"So I’ve been with this guy for a few years now, and up until recently it’s been an open relationship. During that time, we began to get into the free love scene and had a lot of fun. I think he enjoys the fact I’m bisexual a lot, and we explored that together. We spent a lot of time together, and did other things of course, like go to dinner and movies. I quickly began to think of him as my boyfriend. 

Eventually I really felt ready for a relationship. I didn’t really want to be seeing other people, cause I wasn’t anyway. I was putting my time and energy into him. I’d still see jewelry and love notes from other women lying around his apartment, and it began to hurt. I confronted him about it, saying that I wanted to be exclusive, and he shut down emotionally and didn’t respond. I took that as that no, and walked away. Some time passed and he asked to meet me. He comes forward and said that he isn’t very good at expressing himself emotionally, and told me that he does actually wanna exclusively date. He brought me home to meet his family this thanksgiving, and that meant a lot to me cause I felt like a girlfriend instead of just “some girl.” 

He also mentioned that he still wants to go to those parties with me. I have no problem with that, if we’re going as a couple and it’s an experience we share together.... but once in awhile. The night we officially got together we walked into a club and he encouraged me to make-out with other girls, but I just wanted to kiss my now boyfriend. 
He now often sends me notices about parties asking to go, or if we dirty text, there’s always mention about another girl joining. He often DMs me on insta different free love/sex positive posts.

I get nervous that that’s all he wants to do. I’d love to go on a date to a museum, or a ballet, or something more toned down and just enjoy time together, but when I suggest things like that he acts iffy. 

It also becomes difficult to keep up appearances. I get scared he doesn’t find me sexy unless we’re doing risky things, and that he doesn’t find me interesting outside of that scene.

We’re going on vacation next month, and I’m so excited to be going with him. I’m just nervous that it’ll burn out. I love him and care for him dearly, and I don’t like to disappoint.

She has a very good friend we will call Stephanie, who was also 16. My niece and Stephanie have spent a lot of time together this school year and Stephanie would drive my niece home from track practice most days. 

The Friday before Thanksgiving, Jen and Stephanie went out to dinner and went to the movies.  My niece said they had a great time. 

Saturday they were texting like normal and everything seemed fine. 

On Sunday, my niece had been texting Stephanie but didn't get a response, which was strange. 

Then on Monday, my niece got a call from Stephanie's mom who said that Stephanie had committed suicide on Saturday night. She didn't specify how, or give much detail, as she was obviously upset. 

I feel terrible for Stephanie's family, and for my niece, who is only 16. 

16 is a very important year. What happens during this time can really affect a person's life. My niece, who has never in her life displayed any signs of depression, is now severely depressed. On Thanksgiving, she was hanging out with the family but didn't really talk and went to bed at 730. This is very unlike her. 

I love her so much and I am worried about her. I don't want her friend's suicide to cause her to have suicidal thoughts. I talked to her and told her how much I love her. She told me that her friend never mentioned anything about being depressed and I told her that depression is a silent disease a lot of times and people don't open up to it even though they should. I also explained that many people experienced depression at least at some point in their lives. She didn't open up to me very much and was just not herself. 

Since then, I have been texting her daily to tell her i love her and to try to chat a little. We live about 5 hours apart so I haven't been able to spend time with her like I'd like. 

Any suggestions on what I can do or say to help my niece? 

The funeral is tomorrow so I know she'll be having a difficult day. I want to make sure that she knows that i'm here if she needs to talk and that she can trust me.

My worst fear is that she will fall into a depression and that something could happen to her. Any advice is welcome!",relationship_advice

At the end of the day, sometimes I stubbornly hold onto these ideas and sometimes I just cave and text/apologise etc. Which of you do these same things and do you hold out or do you cave?

38,e6qc3r,rkames517,1575591274.0,1,Roommate (M21) broke my (M20) 200$ headphones and is trying to replace them with 70$ ones. What do I do?,"I'll try and keep this quick.

My roommate kept taking my headphones without my permission and I haven't seen them in weeks because I figured they were in my car. Turns out hes had them in his car, and uses them when he works out. Last night I got a text of him saying hes really sorry and that they broke at the head, but still work if you put tape on or something stupid like that. Apparently he was doing some incline dumbbells and they slipped off his head onto the floor.

Thing is, I was studying in the living room and wasn't on my phone, him and my other roommate came back said nothing to me, and went to his room to play on his xbox. It was probably an hour after he was home when I checked my phone and saw the text, I was confused because I didn't even know he had them. I was obviously pissed and asked my roommate other that went with him what the fuck happened, and he explained the situation and said he'd buy me new ones. I confronted the roommate who broke them and he tried playing it off as a joke, blaming my other roommate for not catching them. I had to study and I didn't really want to start a confrontation because it was late and apparently he was going to buy me new ones.

Fast forward to an hour ago, he goes to the living room where I'm studying and starts watching TV. I sarcastically say ""wow I wish I had some soundproof headphones"" and replies with saying that they weren't even that good and were cheap. This sets me off, I've never actually yelled at him in a serious way before but I said ""what the fuck do you mean their like 200$"" and he replied saying that their only 70$. I literally bring up the the website and he says that their 70$ on amazon. I looked them up and their used ones, and when I said that he replied with ""well yours weren't new"". Also went on to reemphasize that they ""weren't good"", ""theirs better ones out there"", and said I hardly even used them because I use Air Pods. I walked away before I ended up getting more pissed.

So what should I do? I'm not a big confrontational guy which is why I think he tried to ease the tension with jokes but I'm livid rn. He tried telling me the value of my headphones, acted like it wasn't a big deal, and tried blaming it on my other roommate. I'm very pissed and not thinking clearly so i'd appreciate someone with a cool head to give me some advice.

TL DR: Roommate took my headphones without telling me and broke them. Proceeded to joke about the situation and blame my other roommate. He wants to buy me a used pair for 70$ saying mine were old, shit, and not worth 200$ despite me taking great care of them, working and looking exactly how they came out of the box.",relationship_advice
39,e6qb8e,Cledo_,1575591165.0,1,I have contact with my ex.,"I once met a really nice person online. We had a nice chat und our contact continued. Fast forward 3 years of daily contact we were a couple. She was the love of my life (18 at this time) and it went very well this far. It was my first relationship and my time in school wasn't that pleasant either. After 1 Year of distance relationship (we met once a month for a weekend long) things went differently.
I was a trainee and lived in an apartment with 2 other guys. I wanted to move out and luckily she finished school and wanted to study. We had a little gamingroup with 2 other people but still had ""couple-days"" were only we played together. She began to shorten our playtime together and made day's, where she played only with them. This difference grew and the time with me shortened more. This made me pretty depressed and I went more silent in group conversations and my mood wasn't good. Because of that the contact with the others (especially one guy who she told not to worry about). This was kind of a hellish loop. In the whole time she went more and more cold to me. After 6 months of me falling apart she decided to break up. 
I tried to lose the contact and tried to forget her. I was down all the time but went on with my life. 

This was the prequel to the today's events. 

A month ago (now 21) I recieved a message and we had a text chat about us.
She told me that she worried about me and couldn't forget me and so on. She then told me that she is now in a relationship with the guy she told me not to worry about. BUT the relationship began ½Year after the breakup. This was when I literally felt something dieing inside me. I try to have contact to her even though it hurts very much. I do not give him any guilt, but unconcious I have very negative thoughts about this person. 

Now to the question: How can I deal with such a situation and how would you feel about this. 
I feel still down but in contact with her I feel less better.
And how can I get some self esteem, as I do always lack some.

40,e6q9ie,LimpBlumpkin,1575590964.0,3,Dating Help- Would like to date an older female,"Just for background I am a 21 year old male. I have only ever dated females my age, but after a 3 year relationship ending months ago I find myself only wanting to date women older than me 26-32. Someone hopefully more mature and ready to settle down. 

My main question is, is this odd? Will women typically in this age range be okay with dating someone as young as I am? 

I have a stable career in the STEM field, and do look like I am in my mid-twenties if that matters. 

If so where would be a good place to meet women in this age range? Work is out of question since my field is mostly middle aged men, I’m out of school, and have a small friend group. I have tried apps such as Tinder, but tend to only find females my age that I’m not interested in because of maturity.",relationship_advice
41,e6q8dv,GomezTE,1575590833.0,1,I'(19)m so incredibly stubborn and my GF(18) just got a new haircut. I don't know how I should deal with the fact I loathe it?,"I'm sorry if this is kind of all over the place, I don't know what order to take to make all of this coherent.

My GF used to have really long hair, wich always smelled really nice and I just find long hair beautiful. But she wanted to mix things up by cutting it a bit above her shoulders because she wanted it short.

I have a bit of a bad relationship with short hair mainly because around 4 years ago I was in a super mentally abusive relationship with a girl with short hair. She cut herself daily, sent snaps of it both during and after and blamed it on me. I stayed with her because I was scared and because I thought that deep down I loved her. That relationship ended with her suicide and the hair is what has been stuck in my head. 

But this is not her problem and she should not have to worry about it (she knows though).

But then she spoke to one of our shared best female friend. She basically told my GF that my opinions will never matter and that she should do whatever she wants to. Whilst yes, she can do what she wants to do, and my opinion only matters if she wants them to. It's okay for me to say it, it's okay for my GF to say it. But when someone outside tells my GF that my opinions will never matter to her and that she should just get her hair cut without saying anything to me before hand. I get mad, and the reverse psychology starts, I get even more set on that I HATE short hair(stubborn y'know). But she ended up not cutting it that summer for the same reason.

A couple of weeks ago she got her hair cut, I was on the edge. When I saw it I thought it looked quite okay, still worried and not quite sure. She looks reaaally nice from behind, the hair kind of uplifted that. But I still missed the long hair. Well the same day I saw her in that hair for the first time we were hanging out with this female friend and her BF, my best friend. The FIRST thing that she said about her hair was ""it looks GREAT, now you actually have some character"" LIKE WTF. Now just because she said that my mind is 100%sure it hates the hair even though she does look good. Neither me and my GF said anything because we both just found it baffling.

Even though it's just hair, my mind constantly shifts between the suicide, our friend, the fact that I prefer long hair, our friend again, and that she actually does look nice.

I just want to know if I should talk to her about it, or if I should just keep quiet about it and not ruin it for her. Because of my past and because of our asshole-ish friend it's really bothering me, but it still looks kind of okay. But I feel like I can't compliment her because I'd just be lying, and she only asks about my opinion when others are around.

If she said it was too much of a hassle or it grows back too quickly I'd be totally fine with it. Very reasonable answer.

45,e6q79a,Legitimate-Tomorrow,1575590690.0,1,What am I (30f) doing with a 50 y/o man?,"I am 30 years old, I have had 3 long-term relationships in my life and they have all been with men my age, but I have a secret that I partake in behind closed doors: I keep older men around because they soothe me when I am lonely.  When I say older, I mean late 40s to 50s, well put-together men. My ex partner of 5 years, things were great at first, but he joined the military and became aloof.  We stopped having sex, there was no affection, and the relationship felt like we were roommates.  I felt unlovable, and would later confirm he had cheated.  I took up solace in 2 older men.  One of them spoiled me with gifts, the other spoiled me with affection.  I felt wanted, secure, and valued.  My own partner wasn't even doing that for me.  My partner and I separated, and once again I found myself seeking affection from an older man.  This particular individual and I spent a lot of time together, it did turn sexual, and I felt very close to him.  He listened, he cared, I could cry in front of him.  It felt very safe. It served it's purpose, but I never wanted to actually form a life with anyone that old. Everyone understood that.   


Almost a year later, I ended up  meeting a guy my age, let's call him Jake.  He was my 3rd relationship, and we were together for 2 years.  He is so different from my ex partners, we have so much in common and I love him; our immediate and future goals line up beautifully, and with Jake's issues removed, I could see a life with him. But I felt like I had to beg for affection, beg him to love me.  I struggled with insecurity.  It's easy to tell people to find security and value within themselves, but the truth is, we get our security from feedback in the way people treat us.  Again, I felt unlovable.  I don't mean to sound any type of way, but I am in shape and attractive, men hit on me all of the time, why wouldn't my own boyfriend touch me? I decided to break it off with Jake, because I had went through feeling unloved before, and I made the decision to not go through that again, I decided to find what I needed -- Someone who would freely love me, and value me.  A man who I didn't have to beg to love me.  After the breakup, Jake ended up going to therapy to find the root of his intimacy issues.  We kept in touch and were still sleeping together, he has been in therapy for 5 months now and I can say I see a big difference in his behavior.  The issue is, the day Jake and I split up, I once again found myself with a 50 year old man, let's call him Robert.  While he isn't Jake, he gives me everything Jake did not. I felt like I was healing with him:  I am lovable, I am valued, I am appreciated. I no longer felt crazy for craving affection. Robert lives in a different country, so we predominantly talk over text. I miss Robert, I love the feeling.  We say we are a couple, but for me, it started out as nothing more than a tool so I could heal while I kept an eye on Jake's progress. I decided I would never, ever, ever, be in a relationship again where I had to beg for affection.  I told Jake that when he was better, we would be together, but in the mean time it was not fair for me to wait around.  


After 5 months of therapy, Jake likes to touch and be touched, he says sweet things to me, but I feel like it is too late.  Why couldn't Jake have went to therapy a long time ago, before he broke my self-esteem? I find myself resenting Jake every day. Whenever he does something I longed for, I have mixed emotions. I like it, but I hate it.  Last week, I flew down to spend a week with Robert, I had an amazing time! But, I was mad at Jake the entire time -- that was all I ever wanted from Jake, to be loved and valued.  That was supposed to be me and Jake on vacation, not me and Robert.  But now I am in this fucked up situation.  I am wondering who I am and what I am doing.  Robert is so kind, and sweet, and great.. But he is 50 and out of shape.  He is not attractive, but he is sweet. Jesus, he is 20 years older than me. Robert and Jake know about one another, and really, I have only spent a week in person with Robert.  But I find myself longing to see him again, we have known each other for 4 months now.  He is captivated by me and says he wants to spend his life with me.  I told him I am not looking to rush into anything serious.  And honestly, I am not sure if he and I will still be talking a few months from now if I am going to be really honest with myself.    


On one hand, I feel like I just want to heal, and see if once my resentment towards Jake fades, he and I could be back together (I did tell Robert that I still feel love for Jake, and am unsure what I want).  I fantasize about that, about me and Jake working out.  Jake is such an amazing person, but his intimacy issues destroyed me.  However, I see therapy has truly helped him, he is almost like a different person, but I can not reciprocate those feelings for him right now because I am so angry with him.  I literally moved out of state go get away from it all and rebuild myself, and there's a very intense feeling of, ""Oh NOW you want to treat me well, NOW you want to fix yourself."" On top of that, I want to enroll in therapy myself.   And then there's Robert, I feel a love towards him, am I falling for a 50 year old, out of shape, aging man?  I like the feeling he gives me.  Why do I run to older men?  I thought that they were safe, that we could mutually benefit one another for a period of time without any strings attached, fulfilling needs and then parting ways; but I have gone public as a couple with Robert, I cut ties with Jake because I need to heal and could not do that while still talking to him.  I feel like Robert is healing me.  I don't know if my feelings for Robert are an illusion because he is fulfilling a part in my that Jake broke, or if I am truly falling for him.  I am a mess.  I am confused.  It was not and is not my intention to hurt anyone.  I have tried to be honest with both of them.  Robert says he wants me happy and healthy whatever I decide to do.  And I know I just want to be happy and healthy with whoever I decide to be with.  As for Jake?  He is the only one who knows my secret, besides the older men I share it with -- He says if our love was real, we will find our way back to one another.  


  
TL;DR - I have had 3 long term relationships, but I have a secret: I crave intimacy from older men when I feel unwanted.  My ex bf and I broke up, I long for him, but he wasn't giving me what I needed.  Now, a 50 year old man is.  Am I falling for him, or is it an illusion?",relationship_advice

We've been married for a year now, and have known each other for about 3 years. We met while in Uni, so as much as I wanted to learn Mandarin/Cantonese (Her family is mostly Canto), I was too focused on trying to finish school and get a decent career so I haven't had much time to learn, other than listening to audiobooks that give me the absolute basics.

I'm nervous because family is a big deal for most Chinese people (or at least it is for her and her family), and I won't be able to communicate with hers effectively enough to build a relationship with them. (Also I feel bad that my wife will have to be my personal translator the entire time) They are definitely going to accept me, congratulate us, wish us a happy marriage, etc - But I just wish I could build something more with them, you know? Our trip is in a couple months, and I'm trying to jam as much Mandarin as I can into my system, but I'm not a great learner, so it's not exactly easy for me. 

Not only that, but this is my first time flying out of my home country (USA). It's a 16 hour flight, and it's a super new territory. As curious as I am to learn about her culture, be in a new environment, and travel to a new place, part of me is just a little nervous that something will go wrong. Maybe it's a little of excitement mixed with nervousness. But I feel like that will go away once I'm actually there.

Yes, I've talked with my wife about all this. She's done a wonderful job of reassuring me that things will be okay, and that there's no rush to learn right away.

49,e6q5qb,Ahhhproblems,1575590502.0,0,He got lunch with his ex-fwb when he was supposed to hang out with me.,"I’m (19F) essentially in a relationship with (19M). We dated for a while last semester, broke up because of family problems, and are together again without using the boyfriend and girlfriend label because of the family problems. We are exclusive and in love.

We always hang out at certain times during the week, but this week when I texted him to see if he was in the usual location we meet, he didn’t reply. I waited for a while but left the location after 20 minutes. An hour later, he texted me that he had gotten lunch with an old friend.

I was pretty annoyed that he blew me off and told him so. He said he was sorry and knows he should have told me that our plans had changed before so I wouldn’t have wasted my time.
As I was thinking about this, I realized his ex-fwb who he is still friends with, is usually in the same location at this time. I became really upset at the idea that he would rather spend time with her than me.

In truth, my feelings about her are complicated. She’s made comments that make me uncomfortable, like saying my man was still cute, but she has a bf so nothing would happen. The previous week she had texted him for about an hour, chatting about life. I am certain they are just friends, but their friendship makes me uncomfortable because I don’t think you can be platonic friends with someone you fucked. For me, the sexual attraction must still be there.
I was going to tell my man about my jealousy regarding her soon, but I was debating whether I had any right to, because I am not his “girlfriend”

Additionally, I am aware that he didn’t know I was jealous of this girl before he got lunch with her. I am not upset about that.

I am upset because he chose to prioritize her over me. I didn’t think that I would explicitly have to tell him that prioritizing a girl he used to fuck over me would hurt my feelings. We don’t see each other that often, and I’m heart broken that he chose to catch up with her instead of spend time with me.

I confronted him about this and he said that he completely forgot that we usually had plans and ran into her and they got lunch. I told him I am hurt by his carelessness when he didn’t consider me. There were so many points when he could have thought to text me and tell me what he was doing and didn’t. He also didn’t tell me he as getting lunch with her - he kept using the word old friend until I asked who it was.

Am I wrong, Reddit? I’m hurt that the man that I love didn’t put me first in this situation, carelessly forgot about me when we had plans, and didn’t care enough to prioritize me over a girl he used to fuck. He’s apologized but I’m still hurting. We’ve discussed boundaries regarding the girl now, but I don’t think I should have had to tell him who comes first. I know we need to have a more general conversation about boundaries first.

He said that he didnt like her of course idk if he’s lying or not but idk if i even care anymore.

No one beats no one, things may get out of hand very easily, but it doesn't get physical, maybe some pushing around or holding someone to avoid more conflict, but that's it.

I have a good amount of income for myself, but not enough just now, I'm very uncomfortable.

53,e6q1xi,me_florentine,1575590026.0,1,My stepdad (49M) cheated on my mum (43F) and I (18F) have no idea what I am supposed to do?,"Hi, first of all thanks for taking the time to read, I really appreciate it. This is probably going to be a bit of a long post.

So, my mum has been married to my stepdad for 5 years now, and between them they have five daughters (he has 3 and my mum has two, including myself). It has never been an easy relationship for them. They experienced a lot of hate for getting together, and they hurt some people in the process. My mum is a pretty headstrong woman and she has had to fight for a lot during her life. She has also experienced a lot of awful things, and I know that my dad treated her pretty badly when they were still together some 10 years ago: he cheated and didn't want anything to do with my sister and I until they separated and then he decided he wanted custody (he literally just wanted to sue my mum for the money, I doubt he really wanted custody of us at that time). Throughout this time we had to live with my mum's parents, lived in a friend's house, were homeless and then finally built out own house before moving in with my stepdad.

Anyway, I have suspected for months now that my stepdad cheated on my mum (I can hear all their conversations from my room unwillingly because they seem to be constantly yelling at each other) but I didn't want to bring up what I had heard in case I was wrong because that might just cause trouble? The other night though, they had a massive fight--yelling, screaming, my mum smashed a plate and called him a ""cheating bastard"". I had to try an explain to my little sister (15) that sometimes people cheat on people and then they try and work it out and she just kept repeating ""I don't understand, why doesn't she leave him?"" and ""I don't want to live here anymore"" all while they're outside screaming at each other. 

I brought it up with my mum yesterday and she said that ""you don't know the full story. It was just a text message."" And I told her that it doesn't matter that I don't know the full story, there is absolutely NO excuse for him to treat her like that. She kept going back and forwards, saying things like ""I don't know, should I just leave?"" ""I don't to have to move the cats again it is such a hassle"" and Just other stuff like her brain was a mess. What I gathered is that she is scared to be alone once my sister and I move out, and she doesn't want to have to go through all the shit we went though before, but she also has no trust and very little respect for her husband.

It is probably one of the most unhealthy relationships I have ever seen, and I went to a public co-ed school, so that's saying something.

Frankly, I am just one tiny thing away from having a massive go at him, I can't even be in the same room as him anymore. I have zero respect for that man. I have never liked him anyway, he has always come across as selfish, arrogant and very non-understanding, but no I just despise him. I hate living here with him, I always have, and now I hate it so much more, and my sister can barely stand it. But we can't just up and leave my mum here--it would kill her, especially since she has recently lost her mum and dad. 

I am really lost as to how to deal with the situation, any advice or insight is so, so appreciated.

TL;DR: my step dad cheated on my mum and now my sister and I hate living here. My mum doesn't seem to know what to do. Don't know how to deal with this new information at all.",relationship_advice

I don't know what to do anymore.,"Some background, my friend and her ex had been together for 4 years and had lived together for 1 year. They had started breaking up on and off again about 6 months ago. This last and final break up has left my friend completely heartbroken. 
Now I understand break ups are hard and people cope in different ways. However, my friend seems to be going a little crazy. At first she would constantly call him and ask to see him and talk, which I thought was normal. Then she started stalking him and following his car, driving to his parent's house and to their apartment to see if he was there. I would be with her some of these days and would stop her from trying to stalk him and she would agree and say I was right and that she shouldn't be doing that. But as soon as I would leave she would get in her car and drive around trying to find him. She soon became very paranoid that he was with a girl and I had tried to calm her down. This is where things get worse. A couple days ago my friend finds out that he was indeed seeing another girl. This girl happened to be my friend's cousin. Her cousin is 16. Her ex is 22. After finding this out she became very irrational. She stopped eating and was barely drinking any water, she has lost about 4 pounds since she found out. She continued to stalk her ex and would become obsessive about them. She would take videos of them together and would show them to her Aunt.
There was an incident in which she followed them to the apartment they had shared and walked in on them having sex. ( The age of consent is 16 in my state) She hasn't been going to work or school and has devoted most of her time to stalking her ex and her cousin. 
I am just super worried about her, I have told her before that this is unhealthy and that she shouldn't be putting herself through this but she just seems to ignore what I say. I don't know what else I can do for her. Is this normal behavior? 
TL;DR - my friend's ex left her for her underage cousin and she is being obsessive about it.",relationship_advice

Basically we are both first years at Uni and we've both met a 2ndyear. Realistically I think she's way out of my league anyway BUT, I'm still interested in how you would approach a situation like this.   


Been getting to know this new friend lately and he's been quite open with me about how he likes this same girl as me. I haven't said anything yet because not sure how to approach telling him or even if I should. I think I would find telling him kind of awkward as he comes across as the kind of guy who would get possessive of her which feels a bit weird, because it's not like he has any claim on her. Not sure if it's worth telling him or not because of that. Also, feels like it might be a bit of a scummy thing of me to do to pursue a relationship knowing he likes her to, but then again he doesn't own her, and neither do I. She will go for whoever she wants to.   


So my questions are:

Shall I be open with him about my interest in her as well?  
Is there anything wrong with me pursuing a relationship with her? I don't really feel it's fair for me to need to step aside but I suppose he brought her up and I didn't  
Also, hypothetically speaking, if it worked in my favour, what does a friendship with this guy look like even though initially there might be associated feelings of jealously with the guy, or can there be no friendship?   
Lastly, is it even worth moving into a situation which could be messy?

Me and this guy get on well so would be a shame if there was a negative outcome. Just interested in damage control when it comes to these situations and how best to navigate them.  
Again, possibility of relationship is slim, but I reckon this kind of situation is fairly common, so with that in mind, I'm still wanting to hear advice for future situations which would be more likely to work out.

We reconciled and told each other we loved one another, texted the next day and everything seemed great. Then all of a sudden today, complete radio silence. I want to give things a fair chance so we reconciled, I feel like I am walking on egg shells at times and am nervous if I say anything it will lead to him being upset with me.

I want to stick around and be their support, but I am also not a door mat. If we said we are going to work on things, I feel like it has to be both people putting in equal effort for the most part.

Our sex life has gradually gone from 'like rabbits' to 'like, once a week', because I'm just no longer sexually attracted to her the way I once was (which feels painful and unfaithful to say). Worst of all, it has made me seriously doubt our future together. We *have* moved in together, but I imagined by this point that we would be happily engaged, yet I just can't bring myself to make that commitment while this carries on (regardless of how much she keeps hinting at a ring). Her health is being seriously affected, too. She was an athlete when we met, she now gets out of breath walking up hills - she has gained over 70 lbs since we met. I'm not ripped or athletic, but eat in moderation (I'm 6ft and 150 lbs).

If I ever try to make a jokey comment about her snacking while we're waiting for dinner to cook (for example) she gets deeply offended, calls me judgemental, then stops talking to me for the evening. I now sit silently by while she eats unhealthily and in excess, because if I say anything I face being shunned and sitting in painful silence. It's absolutely soul destroying. She seems to always choose the worst options when we eat out, when we go grocery shopping, etc. There's just no awareness about what it's doing to her, and God forbid I try to say anything.

She expresses to me her understandable concern that I don't give her as much physical attention anymore, outside of  hugs and kisses. I never know what to say to her, just that I'll try to be more affectionate... I obviously can't tell her what I'm really thinking, which is ""You have put on over 70 lbs and show no concern for the way I'm supposed to feel about that. If I had done this, you wouldn’t be as physical with me, either..."".

I feel so guilty even just being physically less attracted to her, *and* she suffers badly from anxiety, which makes her quite sensitive and hard to - no, impossible to - confront on the issue. She has expressed wanting to lose weight a number of times, but never commits past a week or so into the routine, then rolls her eyes and calls me judgmental when I try encouraging her to keep it.

Sometimes the ones he likes are girls fully clothed in tight pants just walking in public (not doing anything sexual) which makes it hard to not feel insecure about that in real life (like when we are out together in public).

74,e6psij,thelonew0lf,1575588925.0,1,How to win any argument with a friend or loved one!,"So, a lot of people seem to have problems resolving differences or dealing with arguments with friends/family members/partners, etc.

In my experience, there's a pretty simple way of dealing with that, so long as you're truly trying resolve an actual conflict. Communication is key of course, but irrespective of how well you communicate your stance, the one thing you need to communicate to the other person is that you're on the same side. 

Live it, own it, believe it. If you're in a healthy relationship that should be an easy point for both of you to accept and internalize. If it isn't, I think you both need to really take a step back to examine the state of your relationship to evaluate a more systemic strategy.

Verbalize it too! You'll find the tone of your discussion  changing a lot by either one of you going from ""Well I'm/you're not happy and i/you don't like _____ so what are you going to do to fix it"" to ""Well I'm/you're not happy and i/you don't like _____ but we're on the same side, so what can we do to change this?"" Concessions may need to be made on one or both sides, but that's what healthy compromise is about, too.

You don't win unless the both of you win, plain and simple. That's how you win an argument *with* someone, not *against* them.",relationship_advice
75,e6ps4b,JeanpaulRegent,1575588879.0,2,How do I communicate to my (26m) wife(24f) that I need her to help out around the house in a healthy way?,"My wife and I have been married for a little over a year, I work full time and she goes to school, when we got our own place at first chores were split up rather equally, she would cook and I would do dishes, pick up after ourselves, she would do the laundry and I would handle vacuum and mopping.

Slowly, things became less equal, she prefers my own cooking over her own and so I gradually took on that role. Then she started picking up after herself less and less, and is doing less laundry. I tried to impress upon her the stress it was putting on me and I regularly get apologies and promises to pick up more and so far nothing.

I cant keep up with it all alone and gradually things have gotten pretty bad. Theres mail just thrown about from when she gets it and soda boxes just laying around that she pulled out of the fridge and did nothing with. I cant walk in our bedroom because theres just a carpet of clothing she insists is not all dirty and just needs sorting. Theres always dirty plates and half empty soda cans laying around.

I grew up in an abusive household. So my immediate instinct for getting people to do their chores involves screaming, gaslighting, breaking things and, several versions of emotional manipulation. I do not want to do this, I suppress these urges and instead try 'I feel' statements and heart to hearts. So far all I get back are empty promises.

I just am at a loss for what to do at this point, I can't keep up and I'm getting no support.

79,e6pqqg,xthrownx,1575588727.0,3,"I want to expose an untruth about me that’s hurt me immensely. But revealing the truth will humiliate my mother, so do I look after my beautiful loving mother, or myself?","My mother (65) had me (25F) when my parents were in their mid forties. A brother had already died before I was born, and shortly after my birth my older sister developed cancer and died when I was four. My parents grieved for a very long time, in fact, I don’t think they have ever stopped. All I can remember from my childhood was their quiet, sad, occasionally angry grief, spotted with some happier moments. Good parents, but struggling after being dealt with such savage blows in life. 

This back story is important for later on. A family male relative was acting inappropriately with me when I was about 8. I was terrified and told my mother who questioned him but of course he denied it, but he then kept away from me. I told my mother as my father was always uninvolved. By the time I was 14 my parents decided they wanted to retire to a small inner city apartment but without children, so my mother asked me to go live with my relatives. The same inappropriate relative. 

This hurt me immensely as I had to leave school and work full time to support myself. Of course, once in my relatives care I was sexually abused almost daily by him, and by other male friends he had over all the time. I had no one to turn to. 

I eventually told his wife and that’s when all hell broke loose. I was kicked out, homeless, and suffering ptsd. But the worst part was being ostracised from my large family. The male relative who abused me accused me of instigating everything, and was believed despite other relatives witnessing him groping me, walking into the bathroom while I was showering, stripping me naked to hose me off etc. 

One reason they believe him is because my mother has told everyone that I asked to go live there. If my mother would tell the truth, that SHE asked me to go live there I think I’d get more family support. She told everyone it was my idea, and because my relative is saying that I was the instigator, everyone believes him. I’ve been attacked over it, told I was heartless for wanting to leave my parents at 14, and generally treated like I’m scum. But I just keep that piece of information to myself to protect my mother. 

My mother has suffered greatly in her life and I don’t want to hurt her anymore. I can’t imagine what she has been through losing two children, and I’m not angry so much as hurting. Actually I’m suffering greatly. I just don’t know whose feelings are more important here, and I’m wondering if you could give me some insight.",relationship_advice

83,e6pq3w,ThrowRAstupididiot,1575588658.0,1,I (25M) led someone on (24F) & I don't know how to deal with the guilt,"I'll try to keep this brief, but it's hard to. The situation is as follows:

I met a girl through Tinder in late July & we hit it off well enough. Between July-early November, we spent an increasing amount of time together. I really enjoyed her, and fairly early on, I told her I was interested in actually ""dating"" her (probably far too soon, talking late August). Ultimately, we agreed not to do that. But, throughout all that time, she started to think of me as her boyfriend. But as that time passed, I started to feel less. In September, when classes started, I met a girl that I really hit it off with. I had NO intention of developing feelings for her, but as we hung out together on campus & at bars, I started to feel something for her. I felt horribly conflicted, I started to dread seeing the girl from Tinder.

Unfortunately, I was overcome with guilt & shame about how I was feeling, and I didn't cut things off when I started to recognize that I needed to. Finally, in early November, I had the courage (well, not really courage) to tell her I didn't want to go on as we were. I chickened out, and instead of telling her that I simply wasn't interested, I chickened out & told her that I just wasn't ready to commit, that I didn't feel like what was happening between us was healthy (there was a host of reasons why we were/would not have been good together, but that seems irrelevant), that it wasn't what I wanted, and that I wanted to step back & work on myself. While all of those things were certainly true, I did not tell her that I was developing feelings for someone else. We attempted to remain friends (in hindsight, a HORRIBLE mistake), but again, I did not tell her about my feelings for this other person. A few days after all of that, the girl I met in class confronted me that she had feelings for me, and I admitted that it was mutual. I have been ""seeing"" the girl from my class for about 2-3 weeks now. About a week ago, the girl from Tinder found out that I immediately moved on & she subsequently messaged the girl from my class (and her friends) about how horrible of a person I am. I don't blame her.

The timeframes make this situation extra awful. I did fucked everything up in communicating with the girl from Tinder that I was becoming uninterested. I fucked it up more by not being entirely honest about why I didn't want to see her. I guess my intentions don't matter, but I was so scared of hurting her that I ended up hurting her 100x more, and I feel absolutely horrible about it all. I have my own list of justifications and ""buts"" and ""well technically"" but objectively, regardless of how I feel about the situation, I led the girl from Tinder on. I don't know how to deal with the guilt of that.

To make things worse, the girl from Tinder is telling people that I weaponized her mental health against her, which is an accusation that I'm completely dumbfounded about & not even sure what to say. I made the mistake of looking at her Twitter today & she has just been tweeting about how shitty ""fake deep sadboys"" are (a group of people that I often joked about & loathed, but apparently I am now a part of) and how those people treat women poorly. I've never been accused of anything like that. I don't know how to forgive myself, I don't know that I should.

I can't possibly be the only person who has dealt with a similar situation. I've been led on plenty of times in my life & I've learned to just forgive, get over it, and move on, but having now done it myself, I feel utterly irredeemable. I have never wanted to hurt someone who has hurt me in that way, but the girl from Tinder seems hellbent on hurting me. I've always prided myself on being friends with my exes, on treating everyone with respect, and on being decent. I can't say that I do those things anymore. I don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I led a girl on in a 'casual' relationship & then immediately after cutting it off, entered into a new uncasual relationship. I don't know how to deal with the guilt, or if I even can.",relationship_advice
84,e6pq2i,SchwiftyGameOnPoint,1575588653.0,1,"My(29M) girlfriend (25F) has become increasingly distant, negative, and standoffish. Not sure if it me, her, or us but I have having a hard time managing.","My girlfriend and I have been together for about 5 years now live together in California. We met in college and started dating right before I graduated. We had a really good relationship starting out and for what felt like a long time. We used to joke, laugh, play, and generally enjoy everything together. Now it's impossible for me to make a joke without her taking it as a personal attack. She has become more and more negative.  


**---A bit of history of myself and my girlfriend, feel free to skip over if you'd like---**

In the last two years, I discovered that her mother used to hit her and her sister as a child. That continued until she was maybe 6 or 7. Her family is overbearing, she is the oldest, and she is the black sheep of the family. Her two younger siblings both live at home still. As she sees it, she is often treated poorly by her family but I think she also feels that way because everything they do is opposite of her ideals. They love to spend money and be wasteful and are often inconsiderate, where my girlfriend is very frugal, hates wasting anything and is very environmentally conscious, and is always considerate of what their needs are. My girlfriend had a relationship that she looks back on as abusive. She says she wasn't raped or anything but she always describes it vaguely. 

&#x200B;

I on the other hand grew up in a very attentive household. No traumas growing up. However, every relationship I have started has been with a person who has had some sort of mental disorder. Bipolar, depression, borderline personality disorder, to name a few. Not sure why I am attracted to these women. Perhaps my mother shows some signs of this but has never been diagnosed, I don't know.

Recently, I have suffered some trauma as some might say. In the last \~9 years, I have lost all 4 of my grandparents. One grandmother(Mother's side) had suffered from dementia for about 4 of those years before passing. Toward the end of her life, my other grandmother(Father's side) died of lung cancer and one of my grandfathers(Mother's side) began to have trouble taking care of himself. My mother and I moved in there to help care for him. I had just finished school and was also working.  After losing both grandmothers about two years after, my grandfather (Father's side) died from the same lung cancer and my other grandfather(M) continued to decline. About a year after that my grandfather(F) passed away. Grandfather(M) was moved in with my parents and I got my own place again. In the final year (a few month ago now) my grandfather(M) passed away.   


During those \~9 years, I had dated another woman who had a child and that fell apart hard, I started dating my current girlfriend, my parents nearly divorced on multiple occasions, the company I worked for went under, we stopped affiliating with parts of the family, things in general started falling apart.

  
Now, things are good, I have new and reliable job, making enough money to pay for the bills. My parents have made amends and are trying to find life better together. My girlfriend and I got a dog (which is a whole other story). Compared to how things were, things are great and I haven't felt this happy and relieved of stress in a long time. However, I feel like that's been going backward now.

My girlfriend was on the implant and the hormones were messing with her. She was on it for about a year and she attributed her mood swings to that. However, she has been taken off of it and is on a non-hormonal birth control for several months now and she seems almost worse.  
**---End personal history---**

&#x200B;

My girlfriend constantly acts as though I am mean to her. She says I am always verbally attacking her. However, I don't feel like that is the case.   
Example from just a few hours ago, we were talking about her getting groceries after work. A bit through the conversation our dog was indicating that he needed to go outside to use the restroom. I told her I was going to take him out and she got mad because I was interrupting the conversation and putting the dog before her. I just didn't want him to pee/poop on the floor. After I came back in, I asked her what we needed to get from the store and she proceed to berate me and say ""Well, if you hadn't gone outside, you would know."" I attempted to explain that I didn't want him to go on the floor, he doesn't understand, ""Hey wait 5 minutes for us to finish this conversation and we can go,"" he just goes when he needs to go. I asked her why she was getting so mad and she told me that I was the one getting mad and that now she is just mad because I was mad, but I didn't do anything. Then she started throwing at me how she was running late for work too. I said ""That isn't my fault"" (which I probably didn't need to say but I was a bit upset) and she began slamming the doors and yelling at me about how I am ""the worst.""

Things like this happen all of the time. At the flip of a switch she becomes angry at the littlest things and then it ""ruins her day"" and she proceeds to brood, ignore me, or just be generally inhospitable for the remainder of the day. Sometimes it will even go on to make her upset the next morning which ruins her morning and if her morning is bad it means the whole day is bad.

 

I constantly go out of my way to do nice things for her and to try to make her happy. However, they are all band-aids. Sometimes she even gets mad about it because people will say that I am such a nice person to her, that I always want to take care of her. She even throws in my face about how ""perfect"" I am an that she can never live up and that everything is always her fault.

Last week she went to visit her family and she told me she was crying in the bathroom because of how different she is from them. How she doesn't like how they act. How she wishes I was there (I couldn't go because I had to work). She gets upset when we are apart, always talks about how everyone is against her and people put her down, and then does the same thing and says I am against her when we are together. 

I don't know how to get her to see that she is against herself. Most of the time the people she is ""against"" are her friends or me and are often times just trying to be with her. 

I feel like, between all of this, the past, and my own natural attraction, that she must have a mental condition as the behavior feels quite the same. However, she refuses to talk to anyone. I once got her to talk to the people at her the counseling department at her college, and she didn't like that person. Now, through her work, she has a ""Life Coach"" who she sees once per month (sometimes less, and less so than that around holidays). The life coach helps her keep her goals on track and she does talk about personal problems occasionally when they meet up but I don't think this is the same thing as seeing a professional. I have told her that but she gets mad saying ""Why isn't that good enough for you!?"" If I justify it, then she goes back to talking about how much she hated the person at her college because they made her feel bad.

My girlfriend and I have a lot in common, we have a great time together when we do, she also has great ideals and goals, etc. However, she has just gotten worse at handling her personal life and feelings.

I am so lost, honestly, I sit alone when she is gone and just ponder what to do or how to make things better. Trying to see what makes things so bad when our life is so good now. We have come out from bad times and made a good life. It's not good enough?

Ive I own this girl for a while (mutual friends) I’ve been talking to her a lot more recently as friends, completely as friends. Talked non stop for about 2 weeks
She knows Me quiet well tho and she knows that I would just speak to anyone whenever just so I can speak to someone 
But basically I quite like this girl and judging on the fact that she seemed to want to speak to me a lot and actaully made an effort to speak to me that possibly she liked me a little to (I know that the fact she wants to speak to me is a terrible reason for thinking she might be into me but idk I’m quite insecure I jump to false hope I guess)
Anyway eventually she ignored one of messages after I sent it quiet late and she woke up the next morning and just didn’t reply 
That night she posts a photo of her cat on her snapchat story, and again I jumped to a conclusion. We spoke about our cats a lot and sent photos of our cats a lot to eachother and she hardly ever posted stuff on her Snapchat story unless she was with friends which she wasn’t at the time. This led me to believe that possibly she posted that in hope I would message her, I didn’t message her tho. 
The next day I put on my story ‘anyone talk’ and she replied and we spoke for a bit before she went to bed so clearly she wanted to talk to me. 
My question basically is am I delusional or should I try and Pursue this (Bare in mind she is way out of my league). Was she hinting me to message her or am I just looking to deep into it

86,e6povc,milkygreg1,1575588496.0,1,"28M, 26F Coworkers Dating","I've posted a lot of this bs here before, but this one is new.

Started a new job in June, beginning of July asked out a coworker I was getting interest from. I didn't know her well at all but we went on 7 dates? 4th one we slept together but didn't have sex. Then we slept together and had sex twice after that, while also going on lunch/dinner dates after work. I met her friends at a few shows we went to & got along well, they really liked me and were also inviting me to more concerts etc.

In October I went to a show with coworker girl, went to NY the next day for work. She met me in NY (we work together) and we went to dinner at some fancy place then did some cute touristy shit together after dinner. She ended the night very weirdly by insisting to walk back to her hotel alone (in manhattan, which i wouldn't even make a coworker i'm not seeing do) anyways, that's the last time we hung out together. I asked to to do some stuff later that week & she pretty politely declined so I gave it up & haven't made any attempts since. 

She's made some weird, kind of flirty comments since? and also since then we've actually started getting along extremely well at work and I very much actually like this girl but have come to terms with nothing romantic. 

Today she asked me to read something on her phone. Said it's the ""meanest thing anybody has ever done to her"" so I read it. It was literally some guy just tearing her apart for being a horrible person, trashing her family, trashing her friends, he even mentioned he thinks she's autistic (she's not). I went on to read that apparently she went to the second night of the concert her and I went to the day before we went to NY, with him. And that the entire time she had been seeing him was while her and I were sleeping together.  The last time I slept with her I asked what we're doing & I admit that was probably not the best call to make on my part but I wanted to be clear - she didn't give me a good answer, but I very specifically asked her if she's interested in anything so she KNOWS that I was after a relationship of some sort. 

Why did she share this with me. She HAS to know that is extremely insulting and just plain fucked up. Like was I not clear enough about my intentions? I tend to play things safe and dont go the path of annoying the shit out of women until it goes bad like that, but like how did she think that's something to share with me unless she didn't know I was that interested in her, or is she just plain insulting me?

87,e6pmc9,BiscuitsNbacon,1575588196.0,6,My [22M] gf [21F] kissed another guy in front of our friends at the bar on the night of our 1 year,"Idk what to think. This is my second serious relationship, her first (my first one was on and off for 4 years) we went to the bar last night for Trivia with a big group of my friends and her roommates. She pregamed super hard and was hammered, yelling in the bar with almost everyone telling her to shut up cause she was so loud. With this, idk wtf she was doing but hit me in the nose and it kinda hurt so I grabbed her hand and said ""You're really drunk and need to stop""

She got mad at this and walked over to the bar. Me and my friend group can see her from where we're sitting. She's over there for a solid half hour. And starts putting her arms around 2 guys. Reciprocating a lot of touch. I noticed her grab a guys neck and whisper in his ear. The whole table is watching this and making jokes to me. At which point I go to the other end of the bar and get a couple drinks. 

I head back to the table and she's all over the guys and leaning on their shoulder and ordering shots for all of them. Turns out when I wasn't paying attention, she kissed him. As such, I got another shot and walked home. I felt so disrespected that she did this A) right in front of me and all her and my friends, B) on the night of our 1 year. What the fuck, C) At all. Apparently her and this guy went on a date one time a couple years ago, so there was something there. 

She apparently didn't know what she did until her friend told her. And she started crying and calling me. I didn't answer because I just needed a walk, and wanted to talk when we were sober. So I just talked to my roommate about it that night. It was so embarrassing and devastating cause we hardly EVER fight in the year we've been together, and it was in front of everybody. We were (are?) so laid back, its really nice. 

It sounds like she doesn't think it's a big deal in my opinion. She said ""If you kissed [My female friend who has a bf] I wouldn't break up with you."" I also asked her if she thinks she cheated and she said no. I dont know where I stand on that answer.

I talked to her just now about this and she said she doesn't remember kissing him. I just dont wanna waste my time. I have 1.5 years left at college and I don't wanna waste the time I have left when it's the perfect opportunity to meet other people. She talked about how awkward we were when we first started dating which almost put a smile on my face, but when I look at her I just imagine her kissing that guy. She is begging me to stay but my issue is that, I may get over it, but I think there will always be an ""itch"" in the back of my mind that she is gonna do something like that again. No matter how small that itch is idk if it'll ever go away. I told her I need more time to think about what I wanna do. Cause I'm so disoriented right now. I dont know what to do, I dont wanna waste my time.

TLDR: GF kissed a guy in front of my friend group on the night of our 1 year. Says she was blacked and didn't remember it until her friend told. And she has basically been crying since. I value what we have but I have 1.5 years of college left and don't wanna waste my time if I have to deal with this. Before this incident she also told me that the meds she takes for her depression cause her to black out a lot faster. Please read above for more details of you write a response.

89,e6pjjv,ThrowRAnowLost,1575587893.0,15,I (F32) found messages my BF (M34) sent on his phone and now I'm lost,"We've been together 8 years and have a 3 yr old daughter together.  He's been acting a bit distant for the last 4 months or so maybe more.  He's done this before, but years ago, he would be this way before a major depressive episode.   

Anyway he went outside for a bit and left his phone.  I didn't plan on it, but on the spur of the moment I did some snooping on his phone. I know not exactly ok, but there is history here that I'll get to.  I only had a few minutes before he came back into the house, but it was enough to see some of the messages and pictures.

What I saw has just crushed me.  The messages were on an app called Kik, I'd never heard of it before, but there were messages from a few young women that I saw.  The messages involved findom or financial domination, didn't  know what this was either.  Apparently the idea is women treat the men like like their financial slaves.  

They call themselves dommes while the men are ""paypigs"" or ""human ATMs"" and they try to ""drain"" men of their money.  The two I managed to look through looked like their early 20s, and they sent sexually suggestive messages and pics, along with just degrading, demeaning stuff.  There were a few pics with nudity from one of the girls, and in both these threads showed he had provided some payment to them.

The backstory here is that we had rough patches before, but it was years ago.  He's always been somewhat on the depressive side - I've had issues there too but not as bad.  We had a real rough patch a little around 5-6 years ago.  He had became distant, irritable.  I found out he was having an issue with porn.  Its not that I think hes not going to look at all, but this was excessive and effecting our relationship.  When I confronted him with it and how upset I was, how it might be the end, he kinda broke down and agreed that he was in a dark place and needed help.  He agreed to openness and honesty.

He started getting treatment and medication.  During this time he had no problem with me checking his phone or computer.  He got better and our relationship really blossomed.  Later when I got pregnant, unplanned, we decided we wanted the child.  Following the birth of our daughter we were doing great.  

He really has become a wonderful father and the last three years were really good, until maybe the last 4 months or so.  I thought it was just that we've both been so busy.  Both working, and on different schedules.  Money is tight, rent is hard sometimes and preschool is tougher to save for.

And now this.  Its awful enough he's broken the trust we struggled to build.  And it really doesn't help that these girls are younger and thin.  I've dealt with body image issues in the past.  This is SO MUCH worse than the porn.  These are real girls he's talking to, giving money too.  They are right there on his phone in his pocket.  And I think from the times of messages he's even been doing this WHILE I WAS HOME.  And he's been giving these girls money that we can't afford to lose.  I knew the bank accounts were off.  

Things were so good before, it makes this so hard.  What do I do now?  How can I trust him?  We've been through SO MUCH.  I think he might be off his meds, but thats not an excuse.  And now if I can't forgive him, what happens with our daughter.  I don't even know how we'd get by on our own.

I haven't confronted him with what I know yet, but its been days and I think he knows something is up.  I've been upset, crying and angry, so angry about this, while tryingt o hide it.  I know I need to confront him, but how, and then what.  I'm SO ANGRY at him, and I'm angry at these girls. I feel like I'm lost. I just don't know what to do.

Forgive me if this breaks Reddit etiquette, I'm pretty new here.  I only even found this site because these girls advertise here.",relationship_advice

To put it shortly, my fiancé and I have been together two years. A year into the relationship I learned that he had been cheating on me for several months. He had been talking to three or four different girls on his phone. Nothing ever physical as far as I know. He had recently moved states to be with me, and was not in physical distance to any of them. I chose to forgive him and try to move on in our relationship. 

For the year following that, up to the present now, I have forgiven him. But I have been paranoid the entire time, always worrying if he is doing it again. There have been small incidents over time, but nothing major. And he constantly tells me he loves me and talks about our future. I believe he is genuine. 

Recently he has been on his phone constantly. He planned a trip to go back to our home state (where those girls I spoke of live) out of nowhere. He never leaves his phone alone for a second. Literally. It is always on or right next to him. The major thing is that I found a hotel reservation in his email for his trip home. His entire family lives there and he is going there to see them. We always stay with them. When I asked him he said he got it so he could surprise his family and have space to hang out with his friends. It almost makes sense. And I do know that he loves me. But that worry is eating at me. 

Am I being crazy and untrusting? Or just stupid for not believing he is cheating on me.

For some odd reason my brain keeps reminding me of how lonely and isolated I am and I end up just crying myself to sleep. My main issue is that I wish I had a friend or another human to talk to but I can't seem to make friends.

I'm currently going to university and I play video games in my free time. I try to talk to my classmates but many go out of their way to avoid me. One example was a classmate I knew last semester who I sat by one day, the next day she sat with someone else and now I sit by myself in class. I didn't want to make her uncomfortable or bother her so I didn't try to sit with her. I tried something similar with another classmate that I noticed was eating lunch alone, like me. I thought she'd enjoy company like me but she began to eat faster and gave me a quick ""bye"". Haven't seen her in the cafeteria since.

I have proper hygiene but my ex boyfriend did often call me ugly so maybe people don't want to be friends with ugly people? I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but it's been years since I've had anyone to call a friend and someone to call me their friend.

I never really had much contact with my step mother.  I have a half sister through our father, but she is only 8 years old. (I'm 28) Our father passed away a few months ago and I found out through the grape vine that since his passing, troublesome behaviors in my little sister magically stopped in a matter of weeks. She would recoil from loud noises, have constant problems with wetting herself, isolate herself during playtime at school because she didn't want to be too loud and get in trouble. The list goes on. 

I have been no contact with my father for over eleven years at the time of his passing, but I made sure to keep my ear to the ground in case history was repeating itself with his new wife and child. He moved back to the states from china with my step mother and little sister, dug himself into massive debt before finding out about terminal cancer, and took out many loans knowing he wouldn't be around to pay any of it back. After his passing, my step mother had no savings and he didn't even leave them with enough to cover the cost of his funeral. 

Having recently moved to the UK and getting married myself, I can't help but feel sympathy for her, she's in a country with no family, no in-laws nearby, in a place where her language is a barrier. I am hoping that with her knowing what kind of person my father was and seeing how it effected her daughter, she might be open to hear me out. 

I really just don't know where or how to start. I don't want to just jump at her out of the blue, but I want to at least ask after my little sister and ask permission to maybe send some small trinkets for Christmas.

100,e6peih,ThrowRAistheway,1575587309.0,5,I (M28) feel like my wife (F24) I marriage is falling apart and we aren't seeing eye to eye,"My wife and I just recently at the end of October celebrated our 5 year anniversary. We have two children, 4yr old son and 18 month old daughter. We have been together shortly after she turned 18. We've gone through a lot of crap but I feel like what we are going through right is killing our marriage, we aren't seeing eye to eye on some things and I dont know whether I'm the wrong or she is or neither of us. Theres a lot of emotions going through my head and it's hard to keep my thoughts straight at time.

Backstory knowledge on our relationship. When, my now wife, reached out to me on Facebook, I had just gotten out of a relationship that I thought was to be my high school sweet heart. 3 months of single life after dating someone for 4 straight years. I did not expect to be where I am with her today but that's what I find so great in our marriage. Anyways, we grew closer and she started opening up about her high school years. It started small at first saying how she has been in multiple abusive relationships and it was refreshing to not be in finally. Months go by she opens up more and more. One of her previous relationships her SO at the time would drug her and rape and being young she didnt know who to go to. Once she finally got out of that the next abusive relationship happened. He learned this information and would hold it against her and threaten her with suicide attempts to get his way. Shortly after that ended she reached out to me just looking for someone to talk to. She now has high anxiety, eating disorder and severe PTSD.

She decided to let me in and we became sexual active. Her doctors always told her there was no way she would get pregnant so we never used protection, stupid I know. We start getting real serious and talking about marriage. A year passes by and she has an appendix scare. Turns out it's not her appendix and in fact she is in her second trimester. So I take the time and pop the question and we get married before our son is born.

We go through typical relationship woes. Boths of us at different times were jobless, there were financial issues, etc. We felt like we were stable and decided to try for another kid and were very successful, very quickly. 

We weren't ready. 

We ended up being evicted from our apartment, lived with my parents in a full house for a while, and eventually filled bankruptcy at a chance to give a fresh start. We are smarter financially now but still struggle living paycheck to paycheck.

Like I said we just celebrated our 5 yr anniversary and it seemed like things were getting better. I have felt a bit of distance coming from her and decided we needed to have a conversation that I knew I wouldnt like the outcome. It was a good 2 hours of talking about our feelings and she flat out said shes not happy.

Her love language is gifts. Mine is physical touch. We haven't been sexually active in months outside of our anniversary but she stated in our talk she did that to please me and that's now I want to do things. I took that as she faked it and it meant nothing. I've always had a hard time fulfilling her love language since we dont really have extra funds for me to get her flowers or such.

When I told her I felt like I was the only one trying she flat out said you are not fulfilling my love language so why should I fill yours. Rewind, I have started spending more time with her, giving her lots of compliments and trying to be playful with her to spark a flirty attitude. When I told her her response makes it seem like my LL is reward her response was no it's a mutual agreement that if I do hers she will do mine, meaning I will never have my love tank filled so long as I'm not filling hers.

In our talk she also compared me to her exes and that actually infuriated me as I have never physically hit her and sex has always been consensual as I have been very respectful in that sense i feel.

I'm at a lose of what to do because every day that goes by I'm less happy and more angry over the situation.  A simple I love you is responded with a you too or nothing at all. I dont know that I will get my answer here but I needed to let it out.",relationship_advice

He says he is 70 % gay but I mean i could be in the 30% you know. We started talking about our emotions and he told me he struggled with depression and i told him coping skills i learned while i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt (when i was 12) His mom read his texts and decided that i made him depressed so im not aloud to talk to him any more, we still talk at school and delete our messages when done texting. His mom is over protective of Kyle but  i don't blame her because you know, motherly love, but at the same time, he's 16. His mom is also homophobic and a racist so... yhea.

They believe in things that are unbelievable, different dimensions, world conspiracies, basically paranoia and I’m afraid she lost touch with reality. 
Prior to that group, she was part of another group that was shut down by a “cosmic power” (lol), she recently left the foundation and is going through an existential crisis. The only reason why she quit is because an ex-member who happens to be her friend told her that her mentor who is a practitioner of Theta Healing told her she saw energetically or on whatever frequencies the foundation absorbs 90% of the members energies and it transcends to a bad place in NYC, she believed the foundation had a noble cause to heal the earth and its people, now that her friend told her they saw it being used for bad energy or something that is not virtuous, she quit the foundation immediately.

*Now for the story, let's get into a long but relevant exposition:*

Third year of high school and I finally get how this works and that I shouldn't worry so much about everything. I start to approach stuff in a more relaxed way, and get into an exchange program  that includes many countries. A really nice opportunity.

Also at the same time, I get more involved in the schools magazine and write lots of articles, both scientific and artistic creations.

Since the coordinator for all projects in our school is one teacher, she notices my hardworking in both student exchange projects and the school's magazine, and decides that I'm the best follow up editor in cheif, as the actual one was in his last year and couldn't help from college. Again, a nice opportunity and just a happy time for me.

This also means I get to go to the meetings for the magazine, as before this I was just sending articles and arranging the magazine through Google drive, no personal interaction.

At these meetings I run into the actual editor in chief, The Dude, and get to see the one everyone talks about being the smartest in our school. I just immediately mark him as annoying.

This is The Dude that keeps changing my formatting and images in my articles, the dude that ""interpreted"" some drawings I had sent to the magazine as politic and decided to write an article on politics with my drawings without asking. (Note that the drawings were dinosaurs in costumes saying dumb things, were meant for the comics section). The person that I'm always directed to when I ask the teacher diverse things about the design of the magazine.

Don't get me wrong, I didn't say he was doing stuff wrong or being a donkey-hole to me, but I just got the instinct to avoid him at all costs, and I was also probably annoyed about the fact that he got the last word on any decision regarding the magazine. (By this time I was the junior editor).

Now maybe you will understand my absolute surprise when I got a text from him. He got my number from the group we used to discuss about the magazine. At first it was just questions about the magazine, and I saw it as weird since he could've asked on the group.

—
Claire thinks he started to understand that my opinion counts too and he probably tries to make me feel more involved. June says that he's a boy and those are a different species we can't understand, even if she has a boyfriend.
—

Things go on, I and a few of my classmates are chosen to go to Spain within the exchange program. Such a cool thing, I have never been outside the country and I had relatives there that maybe I could see.

I was talking to Claire about this in the hallway when The Dude comes over and asks something, not making much sense, I tell him that if it's about the magazine we can discuss it later, he nods and leaves. I run into him a couple more times, similar interaction. I didn't want to be rude, but I really didn't understand what he was saying, as he kept repeating words and stuttering. Not something he had done before. 

The week before we planed to leave, I got a different text from him. He was asking me to go get some pizza. And my thoughts exactly were ""What the duck? Is this a joke? Why would he... this must be some kind of prank""

—
Claire and June agree with me, I decide that the best thing to to is to be honest, and I told him that I'm busy with preparation for leaving, and maybe after I get back. I was still curious, you know...
—

The week in Spain was a very interesting experience and a totally different story.

I got back, and in short time he asks if I'm still interested. I say yes, and we meet in a weekend at a restaurant in a park. He's very clumsy but also very elegant, for a park restaurant. He proceeds to eat pizza by fork and knife, and I submit to social pressure and do the same.

We get to meet a few more times, he grows more comfortable around me and I give up being ""a lady"" and eat pizza by hand. The way it should be done.

Then comes the week the Spanish came to us for a week, and he was so involved in any project, always around me. Now I'm a girl, I have instincts and I kinda got a hold of his intentions. 

The Dude found a moment when we were by ourselves, in the park, to share with me his feelings. Wich was also unexpected, but not bad, I don't know how to put it in words.

I told him that it's the first time for me being in this kind of situation and that I don't know what should I say and do. He said that it's ok and that he is patient, (important later), and this is how The Dude became my Bf. 

I of course told him about my first impressions of Him being annoying, he apologized and said that he was shy and afraid to talk to me. Really?

Summer vacation comes, he finishes highschool, gives his exams and enters college (very difficult one, but he enjoys the subject).

My family invites him to come with us in our vacation to the seaside, I must say I'm glad my parents were so supportive of this whole situation of me having a bf. They were probably just as surprised as I was. And that vacation was a very good time.

He used to be so kind, and he was messaging me every day, wishing me a good day in the morning and talking about our days in the evening. I was the first to message sometimes too, but he was usually faster than me. He used to be so sweet and say nice things, we used to have long conversation as nerds do about nerdy things. We were supportive of each other and wishing each other's good luck before an exam was a must.

That until our penultimate date. Was a really nice one, a good time. When he left me home he hugged me, as usual, but asked if he can kiss me. I freaked out internally, I have no idea how that's done and I'm afraid I'll screw up. I tell him that I don't feel comfortable doing that yet, and he seems understanding. Or so I thought...

He stopped messaging me in the morning, okay, college is difficult, maybe he doesn't have time. He's cold and distant in our conversations, even if he remains being polite.

All our conversations are now:

• Hi
• How was your day
• Good night

And if we discuss a little bit more, he gets philosophical and continuously points up that if feelings aren't let to evolve, they wither and it's not the fault of anyone.

I start to get the feeling he wants to break up.

We get another date. He's nice again, but a bit distant. We go to the park, nice time spent there. He gets thirsty, then gets a bottle of water and here comes my torture. He no longer takes my hand, but holds that water bottle like his life depends on it. We walk around the city, I constantly remain behind as he's walking fast and I can't keep the pace. According to my phone, those were 8.4 km of power walking, with me trailing behind. He suddenly stops and say that he has an exam tomorrow and should go home and study. I agree, he should study for it, and maybe he shouldn't went out in the first place? 

A parade passes by us and we were close to the buss station, he leaves by bus, and I tell him I'd like to go watch the parade. He says that he's going to drop me home to be safe... Fine, I don't want anyone to worry about me. We get there, he tries to kiss me, but I don't let him.

He then stops messaging me. That night I couldn't sleep and I don't understand why it hurt me so much.

I told him the next day that I feel he's distant and ask if there's something wrong. He apologizes for the lack of conversation, says he's unsure of his feelings and that he needs time to think. Fair enough.

He stops wishing me good luck before exams, even if we this have brief conversations in the evenings. I still do that to him, anyone deserves luck before exams.

I ask him again about the coldness between us, he says he wished that I showed him my feelings. Then he gets passive aggressive and asks me about what he is to me and stuff like that.
I am honest to him, I care about him and I have developed feelings for him and it hurts me to see that he's unhappy.

We don't really talk for some time. Somehow we get into a conversation, I bring up this stuff again and ask him what should be done. He says he needs time to figure his feelings, then asks for my opinion. I tell him that I think we should discuss our problems and try to solve them, thought that should be done in person. He agreed.

We met after a week, sat on a bench and he said he no longer feels anything, sat up and left. I felt bad.

TL;DR: two nerds get together, he is upset for me being afraid to kiss him.

*And here's my problem,* AITA for not wanting to kiss him? This event sparked the whole disagreement between us, and it's my fault for it.
He's amazing person and I think I love him, even though I'm not an expert in this field. Thought I know he can do better and find a better girlfriend than me, one that maybe doesn't have this many problems with social interactions. 

Claire says to wait for him to come to his senses, June says he is being dumb, family says he probably found another one in college and doesn't know how to break up.

I want him to be happy, and dear unbiased Internet, what's your opinion?",relationship_advice

He’s sweet, kind, attentive, supportive, cleans the house, does everything in his power to understand and help me, and we have so much fun together. The partnership is so great. 

However, there’s always been issues that over time have taken chunks of trust away from our relationship. 

For starters, about a year into our relationship I learned that he had been a no-show at work on some days, for months at a time. During the days he wouldn’t go to work, I had no clue. When we’d text or communicate throughout those days, he would act as if he was at work. He was doing this due to depression, which he hid very well from me. You can imagine my sadness for him having dealt with all these feelings alone, while also my frustration at feeling like he was withholding some pretty sign of any information and essentially lying about where he was all day.

We moved forward from that and I supported him through depression and moved on, together

Then, another issue, his drinking, started popping up. He’d get so drunk that he’d slur his words and his eyes would wobble around in his head. It was an embarrassment and also saddened me that he felt so reliant on alcohol.
We agreed on a drink limit and regularly he’d bypass that limit; cue fight. I couldn’t trust him to drink responsibly and he of course couldn’t trust me to not nag him about how much he drank .

We put it behind us but the issue still rears it’s ugly head. Now we’re dealing with financial issues. We had discussed finances seriously for years, as we decided to move into get her. We had explicit conversations about debts, income, etc. I come to learn a few months ago about hidden credit cards he has, personal loans, poor spending habits. It shook me.

And that’s where we are now. I feel SO SAD. I love him, but his behavior has rocked my respect admiration and trust in him. I don’t know how to move forward and need advise.

Tl;dr; many issues causing trust issues between myself and a man I love and feel loyal to. Unsure how to move forward.",relationship_advice
106,e6pbe9,throwaway25927487390,1575586851.0,1,I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant and my husband acts like I'm an inconvenience.,"*Sorry, it's really long, TL:DR at bottom*

My husband and I used to work at the same local restaurant chain, just different locations. For several reasons, he and I started looking for other places to work about 6 months ago. We were wanting to leave around the same time so we wouldn't have to work opposite schedules for very long. About 1.5 months ago, some drama happened between my husband and the owner, so my husband got the best job he could within a few days, and quit. He now works in a warehouse 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, with lots of overtime because it's the holidays right now.

Being pregnant, hating the fact my husband and I had such different schedules, my husband mentioning how easy his job was, and the fact that the owner started trying to push me out, too, I got a job with my husband. They've promised me great maternity leave and a bunch of other benefits. However, this job is much more intense than I thought it would be, and I'm constantly worried I'm pushing myself too hard. Standing for so long, even with breaks, is very hard on my. I've been having nightmares at night about miscarriage and such.

It's taking a huge toll on me; both the physicality of the job, and my pregnancy symptoms worsening daily. Because of this, I've started to close myself off a little. I'm worried I'll blow up and hurt my husband's feelings over nothing, so I'm keeping my emotions under intense supervision before I act on anything. My husband is getting frustrated because there are days I cant even walk into the kitchen without dry heaving because of my morning sickness. I'm constantly falling asleep. Doing chores are twice as hard as they used to be and doing the dishes is out of the question most days. And my husband keeps complaining about how he's having to do everything around the house. I do try to help out, and with how vocal he's been lately, I've been pushing myself to my limit with everything. When I can do chores, I will do them. Chores are split probably 70/30 right now, and I am actively trying to help out more.

I fall asleep at night having panic attacks about going into work the next day, and my husband would tell me to just have a better attitude. I feel like I'm breaking a little. He loves this job, but he feels awful because he knows he pushed me into getting it, and I struggle with it. If I weren't pregnant, this job would be fine. A few years ago, I used to work 14 hr days, 6 days a week, for almost a year.

It feels like whenever I'm around, my husband is severely inconvenienced. Me being pregnant is a huge inconvenience. Hes constantly asking me questions about the future, but turning down any recommendations I have. How will we afford the baby? How can I continue working a job like this? How can I get a job better suited for me, when most office jobs shy away from giving jobs to pregnant people? He's sending me info about him joining the army, or telling me not to get him any presents this year because we cant afford it. He just thought we were finally going to be financially stable, but now I'm talking about changing jobs. Everything I say or do is wrong, and he's told me he feels the same way, but visa versa. I'm at a loss. I won't get an abortion, idek if I still could at this point, but I won't. He was the one pushing for us having a baby anyway, but now hes saying this should be the only baby we ever have.

I feel like I cant trust my emotions right now, but does anyone have any advice for how to strengthen my relationship with my husband right now? Whenever I try to express my feelings, he shuts it down and starts talking about how awful he feels for making me even slightly upset. It never resolves anything, though.

TL;DR How can my husband and I get past this rough patch when it feels like we're both at the ends of our ropes physically and emotionally?",relationship_advice
107,e6p9i1,barberos3,1575586596.0,1,Is he (28M) messing with me (26F) or is he just very shy ?,"I have known this guy (let's call him David) for over 8 years. When I first met him, he was a friend of a friend of my older brother, and I would see him at parties 2 to 3 times a years. Two years later, I started dating and had a short 3 month relatioship with a guy from the same group of friends. Tough luck, I realized a year later David and that ex were really close. So when I made my first move on David five years ago, he rejected me, because it was weird to date the same girl a very good friend of his had already had sex with a year before (or some other jealous guy shit).

Life goes on, we both move forward. A year and a half ago, I start a new job and meet my new colleague Steve. Steve is a very good friend of David and my brother, and we all start to go out again. Hopefully, my ex is no longer around. David, Steve and I have a LOT of fun, we go on multiple parties together. At some point, drunk David tells me ""maybe I was wrong five years ago, I'm sorry for being immature, let's start over, I am very attracted to you and I'd like to know you better"".

He promises to write me a letter (from the tone and enthusiasm showed, I guess it will be a love letter). So I wait. A month. Nothing is coming so I text him ""Will we see each other soon ? How is the letter going ?"", he answers ""It is very ddificult to write, there are so much things I wish to tell you, but I think of you all the time and I hope we see each other very soon"". So I say : ""wouldn't it be easier to just get a drink sometime and talk about it ?"" he says, ""ok sure !"". But then, he becomes very busy, I go on holidays for a week, I try to text him when I get back, but he's still not answering (takes 2 days to answer), he's always busy... 

It's been two months since he changed his mind and told me I was the most beautiful and joyful woman he's ever met, I get his cute texts every now and then since then but he's never available for a date. What's going on ?

113,e6p62t,simsfanatik,1575586211.0,1,Boyfriend doesn’t take my advice or suggestions. Overreaction?,"I’ve brought this up with him rather vaguely, but I would appreciate a little advice before I bring it up with him in a more serious matter because I’m not sure if it’s something that is better shrugged off or an actual issue.

So I’ll make this short and sweet, my (25F) boyfriend(27M) doesn’t really listen to my suggestions but once his mother or co-workers or literally *anyone else* suggests a similar, if not the same, thing he thinks it’s a wonderful discovery.

For example, I’ll put this in points:

- About three months ago I told BF that he should lay off tomatoes, red peppers, and most other acidic vegetables because it gives him terrible acid reflux. He told me it wasn’t not too bad and he can live with it. I gave him suggestions of other vegetables to eat that would be less harsh on him, but he shut me down and told me it was fine. Last week his mom has started reading a book about eating for your blood type, and all of the vegetables that gave him acid reflux are on there. After she told him he should stop eating these, he immediately did so and hasn’t touched any since. Our weekly suppers had to be changed to fit his needs as to not upset his AR.

- He got bored of listening to music during work, and I suggested listening to podcasts because I *love* them. He told me he would get bored, listening to people talk didn’t really interest him.  That was about two months ago, and two weeks ago we went out and bought a speaker that he could clip on his work belt because the guys at work suggested to start listening to, you guessed it, podcasts. 

- I found a song he would love. Told him, we listened to it, he liked it. But he never did download it and listen to it in his truck *every day* until his mother told him how great of a song she found was. It was the same song.

I mean, you get it. It’s more annoying than anything, and these are just the examples I can think of off the top of my head. But the acid reflux one is the most recent and it’s just irritating me. The thing is, I’m not sure if this is normal and just a silly thing going on? If so I’m going to drop it ASAP. But this is my first serious relationship since my last one which was abusive so I’m still trying to figure out what’s normal and what isn’t.

I feel lost. I've been in this relationship for 2 years and been engaged for 1 year just last month. I don't know if I feel happy with her anymore. I provide all our income, our phones, our house and everything else since she doesnt work, she says she'll get a job but she never does or never hears back from any employer. My single income usually is enough to keep us afloat but just barely, I'm trying to get a second job but there were difficulties in hiring so it's been delayed quite a bit. She always need something new and she gets depressed if I don't buy it for her or gets angry or upset if I tell her to get a job to go buy it. She gets upset or angry any time something doesnt go her way(like I tried ordering her coffee for her the other day and she got annoyed because I got a medium but she wanted a small). 

We fight and yell at each other (usually for no reason) probably about 2-3 days out of the week and then depressed the rest of the week. Maybe we might be happy for a day or two if we're lucky. 

Everything has always been rushed in our relationship and I kinda hate it, she moved in probably within a month of dating maybe two, we got engaged after only dating a year and now she already wants to get married and have kids(which ever comes first). For awhile I wanted kids with her but after no luck and and a visit to the doctor we found out I'm almost infertile due to low sperm count. 

I've had to put off so much of my life already because of her, I've put off so much of my hobby and something I want to make a real living out of because I cant afford to purchase supplies for it anymore. I quit a job that I loved doing so much because we didnt see each other enough(it was a basic mon-fri 9-5 kinda job) and now I'm stuck trying to find another I'm not even sure I'll like as much as the last(same field, new company).

We've both gained so much weight being together too, over 100lbs each easily. I try to get her to exercise with me and eat healthy but she always turns back to fast food because she's either to hungry to want to cook or too picky. She refuses to try going to the gym with me and only does her little home workout.

And most of the times when I was sick his behavior felt off. It might be a bit over-dramatic because it's not like he's out of the house until I get better. He does not refuse going to a pharmacy if needed, or shop for food. But I still feel neglected. Like now, today is the second day of me having temperature around 39C (102F as google suggests) and he went partying with his coworkers. Yesterday he bought some medicine and asked about my well-being during the day of course. But today when I texted him two hours ago (the party lasted for 4 hours already) asking to come home because I felt worse again he replied that he's pretty drunk and I should take some antipyretic and go to sleep. And that he loves me. So I still wonder if it is too selfish of me to expect him to cancel his plans. It's not like he can magically heal me anyway, so I assume it's reasonable that he didn't come home after work. But still in my heart I feel it is wrong. 

Another example, since I'm ranting anyway, happened this summer. I had pretty serious case of tonsillitis to the point where I could not only talk or eat, but also drink water. The whole thing lasted for two weeks and during the most difficult part of it he managed to go party with his friends. He came home after work, brought some food and pills, stayed with me for about half an hour (without taking his coat off) and left. I was all understanding and actually reasoned to myself it was not a big deal, but to the current day it makes me uneasy. As well as the way he treated me in general during that time - saying it's only tonsillitis, he had it many times and it's nothing serious. I know it's not, I'm not an idiot, but hearing such things when I was crying because of pain still managed to hurt me. Anyway, I do have a low pain threshold as he puts it so it does make me a bit of a boy who cried wolf at times. 

And it's not only illnesses, he also went partying on my birthday a couple month ago. We've been together for a couple hours at home and then he left to his friends. He is not very fond of birthdays in general, so I usually don't expect him to make a big deal out of mine. He still gives me expensive presents and all. It's just that I would very much prefer that he give something cheap or nothing at all but make a surprise such as breakfast in bed, going to some romantic place or something. I mentioned it to him of course. His reasoning is that no one made a big deal out of his birthday when he was growing up so he doesn't feel the importance of it. I've tried making his birthdays special but he does not enjoy it as much as I'd like him to. Maybe it's that my expectations are too high, I'm not sure at this point. 

To not make him sound like a total jerk, I believe that he does love me. He does a lot for me, and by a lot I mean really lot. Like putting real effort to help me with my studies. And he was completely supporting me financially when I was unemployed.

And I know people express their love differently. So me considering emotional presence an essential part of a relationship does not mean he can give it at all times. Maybe he already gives even more than he is comfortable with. After all, he's an introvert.

I think the title sums it up aptly. We've been roommates for 3 years and he's one of my best friends. I love the guy honestly. Like any other friendship, there are things we agree and disagree on, and it's not a big deal. It's just this eating thing really gets to me. It's been going on for 3 years and I've just ignored it for the most part. I usually wonder if I should tell him about it but I just forget about it later.

The thing is I have this thing where I get so unbelievably frustrated and angry when I hear people eating. The sounds they make when they chew and swallow just irritate the hell out of me and make me unbelievably angry. Of course, this is a me problem because even when people's mouths are closed and I'm near them, I can still hear them, so I mind my business (not like they can control the sound they make). This also isn't usually a problem because there's enough ambient sound that I can't hear anything. 

But my roommate doesn't close his mouth. I can hear every bite and swallow and I think it's disgusting. Sometimes when he's talking, little bits fall out. My issue is, I've been taught that it's good manners to eat with your mouth closed, but I've also learnt it's stupid to force societal standards on others just because you've been told that's the way it is. Clearly none of his friends have said anything so perhaps I'm the only one really bothered by it or even noticed it. Not like I can say I'm a ""perfect eater"". But guys, I'm sitting here listening to him eat chips and it's noisy and gross and disgusting and it makes me so angry.

I wish I could undo the anger that comes but it's like an instinctive reaction. And I'm also wondering whether it would also be for his own good to know it looks and sounds gross when he eats?

This isn't a major relationship issue, just something I've been ruminating on for a while and I thought of finally getting some feedback.

Is it appropriate for me to tell him it's not a good sight or sound when he's eating with his mouth open and it's kinda gross?

Now I would love to know if it is normal / how normal it is to be at this age and to have not had any girlfriends. Also, the question in the title, what is a 'normal' age to get a first girlfriend.

121,e6p0wa,ThrowRAheartbroken7,1575585606.0,5,I [24F] am wondering if sex with my ex [22M] can be ok?,"So the back story is he broke up with me recently. We were together 6 months and I've known him probably 6 years now. He's trying to balance the stresses of work, life, figuring out what he wants and mainly just needs some time to himself without the added commitment of a relationship right now. We've talked about it a lot. He says he still loves me. I still absolutely love him and always will. I think after I just let him do his thing and have some space we can patch things back up eventually, I just don't know how long that's going to take. And he says he still wants to be friends and have me in his life for now.

Anyways he came over this morning after I hadn't seen him for almost a month and we hung out for a bit and cuddled (we casually cuddled before dating so this isn't a big deal). It was truly a gift and I missed the heck out of him. He mentioned at one point that he's been horny and tried to hook up with a girl last night but couldn't cause it didn't feel right so he went home and I told him I hadn't even tried with anyone either cause I only want to be with him (despite my very high sex drive). He felt it was time to leave (my place) when he started to feel that he wanted things to escalate to sex, but didn't want to ""complicate things"" cause he's sure he doesn't want to be in a relationship right now and still needs time. 

So my main question I'm wondering is, do we really have to refrain from having sex?

At first when getting broken up with I was confused and heartbroken cause we were really happy together and have talked about marriage even. But now I feel like I understand and I'm willing to give him his space for now and see him when I can and just be greatful and try not to push for something more until he is ready. 

I know some of you will say that it's not fair to me and he's stringing me along, and you're kind of right and I was really upset with him at first. But this is the man I want to marry, so I'm absolutely willing to wait an eternity for him. But I don't necessarily want to go that whole time without sex so advice is appreciated!

TL;DR: Love of my life needs some space and doesn't want to be in a relationship right now, but we both still love each other and neither one of us wants to have sex with anyone else. Can we still have sex occasionally in the meantime and have it be ok?

Edit: Also, I am very familiar and have been in a toxic relationship before. He has always treated me very well and doesn't want to be toxic in anyway, hence the concern for sex rn.",relationship_advice

123,e6oyxs,floralcement,1575585379.0,1,I'm (17F) and I can't stand my brother's (19M) girlfriend (18F) coming to the house all the time,"I used to enjoy my brother's girlfriend coming over to the house all the time but now she has gotten way too comfortable. My parents are usually gone and while they are gone I hear quiet disgusting noises from my brother's bedroom and the washrooms. When they aren't doing the nasty, they are being so loud. My brother's girlfriend litterly plays youtube videos from her ipad with the volume maxed or at least 3/4 full AHHH, and I hear super loud sounds from speakers or showers running or any kind of annoying loud noise. I'm a MUSIC PRODUCER, and when my parents are gone I usually record but I can't anymore because of their irritating sound.

Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with people over while I record but my brother's girlfriend is way TOO LOUD and she doesn't listen to me when I tell her to keep it down.

HERE'S MY BREAKING POINT - she's so judgemental. When her friend's are over I can hear her making fun of me. My brother full on convinced her that I am ""mental"" and crazy. I SING AND LISTEN TO MUSIC BECAUSE I AM A MUSICIAN NOT BECAUSE I'm INSANE! When I'm out of public I have a very confident and exuberant personality and I make jokes but now she believes I'm crazy. I got mad at her and told her if she can't accept me then she's not welcome in this house; she made up. (disregarding she wasn't welcome she still came here)

My brother only had the ""get a girlfriend = nice to sister"" phase for like a month in spring but now he's openly rude to me (when I'm minding my own sh\*\*) and she doesn't care.

Honestly just having her around makes me feel uncomfortable and I'm getting bad vibes from her.

I tried convincing my brother to move out but my parents did the opposite.

What do I do??

124,e6oy6t,djsohdjdi,1575585299.0,1,My boyfriend pushes me away and continues to resort to bad habits when he is stressed.,"New to Reddit. I never thought I would write on here but as I read more and more, I thought I could gain some valuable insight.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost four years. He's 35, and I'm 23. When we started our relationship, he didn't have much-- little savings, no job, with his parents. I really thought I knew what I was getting myself into. I genuinely believed that he would be able to do great things for himself and us in the future. Therefore, I didn't care for what he had in the beginning, or that he was this older guy.

Some background:

We're currently living together. He's kind to me, helps around with the house chores, and cheers me up when I'm feeling down. I know that these are basic things (or are they? Idk I'm starting to question myself in what is normal and what isn't) He says he just wants me to worry about school so he tries his best to make house work easy for me.
To me, I thought it was progress and I was just happy with it.


Throughout our relationship there's been a couple of big incidents we've had. 
1. [Around 1 year mark] He asked a mutual friend if she had feelings for him while we were dating. In other words, he would have left me for her. (I forgave him)
2. [Around 2 years mark]When he told me he quit smoking cigarettes, he went behind my back and did it. (I forgave him)
3. [Around 3 years mark]He did coke (I forgave him.......)
4. ^repeat offense x3( I forgave him)

Each time something happened, I forgave him because I saw his growth throughout the years and believed he could change. Might I add he also confessed all of these things to me. 
(I feel that numbers 2,3, and 4, were influenced by his friends that he surrounds himself with.)

All of these big incidents happened to occur whenever he was under stress. At the same time, he would push me away, do something like one of the listed above, and give me a huge cold shoulder. He blames a big part of the stress on me because I'm needy and depressed. 

Now, I'm most definitely not perfect. I do feel that I have been needy in the past but honestly I feel like it wasn't bad. I just wanted some cuddle time and attention tbh (lol) and for him to give me some words of encouragement. But he feels that it is silly, because he takes care of me and helps with house work etc. This is his way of showing his love. However, he has paid much more attention to me these past two years. In the past it was not like that. He would be very work driven to make money for us and barely had time to pay attention to me (mentally)

I've been working on self sufficiency and I would like to say I improved a lot on it. It doesn't mean that I don't have anymore room to grow though. I also started to visit a therapist regularly for counseling and it helps. A lot.

We have also been working on these things throughout the years.
- Communication: Ever since the beginning of the relationship, he's had trouble with communication. If he gets stressed, he holds it in. Then blows up on me and does something akin to one of the above. Communication is probably the most important thing in a relationship to me. So it kills me on the inside to know that the growth is pretty slow in terms of that.

- Self improvement: This kind of ties into the communication thing. Over the years I've suffered from depression and am always trying my hardest to push myself to improve my quality of life, (and self worth.) whether it be mentally or physically. However when we would talk about him and some things to work on, he seems stubborn. Very stubborn. It could take years to fix one thing or days. I'm not sure if I'm saying this properly, but I worry that he does not value his life enough to try and strive for better. 

- Love language?: I noticed that we show our love in different ways. I'm more intimate and love to show him that I care, love, and am happy to please him.
He is more work oriented and wants to get things done around the house or work. He wants to make things easier on me. We've been working on combining those. 

Okay guys, I think that that is enough context. I don't want to make it too long and ramble. So here are my concerns, and here's why I'm posting.

He's been stressed about being out of a job for the past month and a half. On top of that, his dad's health is deteriorating and his father collapsed last night. My boyfriend, very distressed, drank himself drunk and then went to another room and locked it. He told me he wanted alone time. I had my suspicions, but I really wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

I barely got a peep of sleep. It hurts my heart to know that the one I love is suffering and I can't do anything about it. Now I'm starting to worry about myself and if I should really be putting myself through this. It takes a lot of mental work and energy out of me each time something like this happens. But I forgive him and want to help him because I love him and I can see a future perfect with us together.

Okay, here we go.
1. Am I weak and stupid for continuously forgiving him and staying with him? I thought I was strong for trying my best to move on and look towards the future. Things just keep happening though and I am starting to question myself. 

2. Is coke as bad as I've heard? Lol, maybe it's a stupid question? But I'm wondering if I'm overreacting about it-- overreacting as in letting myself be hurt each time it happens. I'm worried he will be addicted to it. (He says he's not)

3. Moving forward, should I just let go of my relationship? I try my best to take care of my mental health and look out for myself. If it means happiness for the rest of my life, then I would. I'm not worried about finding another, I just do love him so much.
I'm also surrounded by wonderful people who would support me if I had a hard time.

4. How can I help him? What are some ways to keep him from going back to bad habits? Or what are some ways to bring up his self compassion?

I am so sorry if this was super duper long and unorganized. Feel free to ask questions if I've left anything out.",relationship_advice

My problem is my anxiety impacts me to the point where I can’t face the idea of approaching the girl I’m interested in. I guess I’m really fearing rejection or making an ass of myself. 

I only have two classes left with her, I don’t have her number or anything and only know the bare minimum about her so I don’t know the best way to approach her.

My friend (32M) has a wife (32F) her and I have always had chemistry. Lots of flirting and we both drink a lot. Our significant others do drink but no where near as much as us. My friend and my wife are both type A type personalities and we're both more than happy to let them run the show. We both have kids by the way. For obvious reasons I won't list their ages, it doesn't really matter anyway. 

So my wife and I had talked a couple months ago about how friends wife definitely had a thing for my wife, and I told her that I think she definitely expressed the same interest in me also. This turned into some pretty hot and heavy fantasy role play and we had some great sex fantasizing a threesome with her. This really got my wheels rolling.

At one of our get togethers, it got late and his wife and I ended up making out in my dark pantry. Ever since she has been hinting around to wanting to be alone with me again. She has been trying to get our significant others to go to my friends company party. My wife said that she should just go and suck it up (she hates formal events). They are coming back to our house afterwards and I am veeerrrrrry confident she's going to try and meet up for another make out session. I've talked to my wife and while we're down to explore sexually with each other, the idea of an affair is definitely off the table. I'm pretty sure my friend doesn't know anything about us making out that time. How should I handle the situation if she thinks its just an affair. She by the way doesn't know how my wife and I feel.

But anyways me and the girl who is currently my ex are in the process of moving some of her stuff back out too her parents house during a break up coming just a year after getting back together. This one came very mutual on the terms that things are just becoming to hard to handle emotionally being in a very small one bedroom basement apartment, on completely different schedules, not being able to accurately communicate because we’re both just stressed to the max, both of us living in a town that we lack connections in.. the list of things that are against us is pretty up there. But goddamn do I love this person.. she’s always been the best connection I’ve had with any human by far. 

We’ve both acted pretty wrong in the past months due to high emotions and it’s led to both of us wanting space and such but during the final wrap up of moving everything out were both sitting here tears in eyes, hand in hand both agreeing it’s very much needed but not what we want. We’ve known each other little over 4 years now been together for almost 3 of that, been through more than I think most couples our age do in twice that time and that’s what has me so conflicted...Were we just really not compatible enough to battle through life together, or was life just currently too much and broke us down? We’ve done this twice now and this time feels worse, just sitting here not knowing if the girl of my dreams is slipping away because of where I am in life currently.",relationship_advice

So she then left for travelling and I gave her space she came back a real different person she broke up with her bf, she then said she was ready to end our friendship totally out the blue. Unwilling to meet. I then explained my circumstances and said xyz has happened and we decided to meet and we spoke as normal for ages again and it was all good all fine. 

Then all of a sudden out of the blue when I got a bf in Feb she went really funny on me. She said happy bday to me in April but since we have not spoke at all. 

So I decided not to be petty or childish and I wished her a happy bday.  I sent to her “happy birthday, hope you’re well and had a good one😌” 
In my opinion it wasn’t really enticing of convo she said “thanks Jen x” do you guys think that really entices convo? 

and I mean idk a part of me though maybe I could make some convo as it’s her Bday but then the other part of me thought we haven’t spoken in 8 months what’s the point? We haven’t really done anything nor spoken partly my fault partly hers partly grown apart

130,e6ovg5,uglyjetty,1575584991.0,1,my boyfriend didn’t tell me he dated and slept with a close friend of mine,"edit: added some more details 

my boyfriend and i are both in our early twenties in college. i met him through mutual friends over a year ago but we didn’t start dating until september this year. 

from the same friend group (i’ve known her as long as i’ve known him), there is a girl who i’ve also reconnected with and started talking to very often over text about intimate, personal details of my life. we don’t hang out in person very much, but i consider her a close friend. i have been talking to her about dating my boyfriend the whole time we’ve been together, including some more intimate details about our sex life (she talks about her love life as well). 

just a day ago, i found out that they dated about a year ago from a mutual friend when i mentioned talking to the both of them separately. i immediately asked them both about it. i found out they dated for about a month and a half and had sex a couple of times. i was completely thrown off guard. neither my boyfriend, nor her or any of the friend group had said anything. i felt like a rock was sitting in my stomach. the idea of my close friend, who i’ve talked to about sex with my boyfriend multiple times, also dated and slept with him made me extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed. my friend thought i had known as she thought my boyfriend would have told me. i’m not upset with her, though i do feel almost uncomfortable talking to her. 

my boyfriend knew i had been talking to and growing closer to this friend, yet never mentioned anything about being in a relationship with her. i feel sick to my stomach and just really embarrassed thinking about the intimate things i had talked about with this friend. it was never anything negative or embarrassing about him, but i was under the assumption that she had never had any sexual or romantic experience with him therefor wouldn’t know exactly what i was talking about. but she does, they’ve slept together and dated and it makes my stomach churn thinking about it. 

i talked to my boyfriend over the phone and in person about it. he apologized multiple times and explained his reasoning, though he acknowledged it doesn’t excuse not telling me a lot sooner, and i know he was genuine. i have forgiven him for not telling me a lot sooner. i’m not really upset with either of them, but i still feel uncomfortable. i still feel like i have a rock sitting in my stomach anytime i think about it too much. 

we’ve talked about this multiple times and he’s apologized genuinely. i know going forth he’s going to be open and honest with me like i am with him. but i still feel so knotted up over this. i don’t want to keep bringing it up with him because i know he’s really sorry. but how do i feel better? 

how do i cope with this? am i over reacting?",relationship_advice
131,e6ovep,nature_2,1575584985.0,0,"At one point, in every relationship I (26M) have, I get sexually bored of my partner","First of all, I would like to say that I never cheated, and all those previous relationships were monogamous. What I really want to know is if this happens to other people or is it just me and what are my options realistically. Also, I know I don't have to follow society's rules of what makes a good relationship but I feel responsible for ending all my relationships and that sucks. 

I am a 26M have had my fair share of dating experience, and I find it that inevitably at some point in the relationship I will get bored of having sex with the same person always and that will lead to a dead bedroom. Earlier this year I broke up with my ex, we were together for 3 years, the honeymoon phase was long and amazing, and honestly in the beginning it was the best sex I ever had.

She was very adventurous and had a lot of libido, she always wanted to have sex and so did I and that's what we did for the first 2 years, we just had a lot of sex. But as time went on, I found myself literally unable to get hard because I've had seen her, and did everything to her, time and time again, and it felt like replaying the same movie daily which got really tiring. We broke up for other reasons, but I would be lying if I said the sex wasn't an issue. 

I feel extremely bad for what I had to do, considering she is super attractive, but I had to take those libido pills to even get a boner. I know it wasn't something related to every sexual act because sometimes I would dream of having sex with other women and would wake up really horny, the idea of having sex with someone else really excited me sexually not romantically, I just didn't want to have sex with her. Not because I hated her, which at that point I didn't, I just wanted some change in my life, someone different that would bring excitement.

After we broke up I stopped to think about it and realized that that happened in every relationship I had, every time I dated someone after I've been having sex with them for some time I would just get bored because there was no excitement there, because I already knew them too much. I never cheated because I got cheated on and I feel like that is the scummiest thing you can do, so I just accepted the DB and not long after the 'DB phase' more arguments start coming and I just end up breaking up with them.

This kinda scares me, because I think that maybe I won't ever be able to have a LTR with anyone since after a certain period of time I get bored of them. Is this normal or am I some sort of crazy perverted person?",relationship_advice

I tried to make her first time as enjoyable as possible, asking for consent and feedback with nearly everything I did. I asked if she was having and fun and whether things were enjoyable and in the moment she said yes.

Still didn’t feel any less mad about the situation.(after being pissed that I pretty much spent my entire pay check on gas and presents when he could have told me he didn’t want to be with me before he got back) I was petty and concerned that his ex (she asked to get back with him) didn’t know he had a girlfriend.

My big sister that I'm very close to is very ill. I'm crying as I write this. To most people I'm a big strong guy, I work helping challenging teenagers,  I do everything to help other people, I constantly deal with other peoples stress and problems, and I like to think I'm helpful and reliable.

But now its me, I just can't cope, I've pretty much spent the last few nights crying, my sister has cancer, she has to have her kidney taken out, but its already spead, she looked horendous when I saw her the other day. Its all I can think of every minute of the day. I feel pure anxiety through my entire body. When I called her on my lunch break I was so distraught I had to go and ask my manager if I could go home, I couldn't even think straight. 

So to the relationship stuff. 

GF has been truly horendous. Sunday accused me of cheating due to a really stupid reason (I've never cheated, nor would I, I'm not like that). Tuesday she again started a ridiculous row after I'd just finished a 14 hour day, saying she hadn't heard from me, even though I'd text her loads at work and called her for an hour when I finished...after a 14 hour day.  Then today just started another ridiculous argument about something harmless I'd said to a female colleague (literally said this stage show wasnt really suitable for kids as when we watched it the lead had shorts so small you could see all her bum!). 

I finally snapped at this and said ""its actually disgusting how you have attacked me all week when I'm having the worst week of my life""

The last time we were at this point, I wasn't patient then and we ended up losing all contact (for 7 years) until about a year ago.

Recently we have kissed and agreed we want to start casually dating; that was in October and since then she hasn't made the time for us to see each other and doesn't offer to make any plans; it feels pretty one sided. She does now have 2 jobs and an informal role as a carer for a parent of hers... Am I being too pushy? Am I being too quick? Should I just chill out?

I loved her more than anything and she felt the same way. We used to fight a lot but we always made up fast and loved harder than the fights. The spark started to fade slightly here and there within the last 6 months, but overall the relationship was doing great and we were talking about kids and life and everything. In October I went overseas for a month, we had never spent more than a week apart, and we missed each other like crazy. I came back in early November and the first 2 weeks I was back were amazing, then we hit a rough patch and was just fighting a lot. She was reeling from a depression, anxiety, stress, and ptsd diagnosis and that put a lot of strain on her. I was going through fights with my dad, friends, and my car died on me. In those 2 weeks, there was still so much love though, it was just the last week we were both so busy we barely saw each other and when we did, we fought. It was getting better though, we was having a fun Saturday together but then we ended up having a fight and I guess she was just done. She broke up with me and got all her stuff from my house the next day. That was 2 weeks ago.

She didn’t even try and work things out. We never had a meaningful relationship talk or tried to fix it. I know we could have fixed it. Since the breakup happened she’s been acting like a completely different person. She has been so cold and distant towards me, like we never happened, like it all meant nothing to her. She was on tinder days after the breakup, and she took mdma and slept with someone 6 days after we split. This is so out of character for her. She would never do mdma or anything like that, only weed, she used to be so against it and say only idiots did it etc. And this wasn’t for my benefit either, I love drugs lol and she would never be into anything other than weed. It hurts that she moved on so fast, we used to talk about never breaking up or if we did she said it would be months if not years before she got with anyone else. Our bond was stronger than any relationship I’ve ever been in, she was so attached to me, I don’t know how we can go from being so in love one week to her doing this. 

I’ve seen her 3 times since the breakup, first 2 were before she slept with someone else and we was making progress. We kissed and the magic was still there. The 3rd time I saw her was after she slept with someone to get the ring back and give her more of her stuff. And we kissed then too, and it was so good and for the 2 hours I saw her, I was happy and we were talking and it was like we could fix it still. Now she’s back to being distant again. I just miss her so much. That was my best friend, my everything and shes just gone out of my life. I miss her more than anything, I’ve barely eaten or slept since we broke up. I am so lost without her, I know I could move on but nothing will ever be like what I shared with her, it was really special. One in a billion. I have to stop talking to her for now because it hurts too much every time, she just rejects me. I wish she could be honest with her feelings, I know she’s hurting and misses me, but she only ever comes close to showing her feelings about me in person these days.",relationship_advice

In May, my dad’s mother, Grandma D, passed away in our home in hospice. She had Alzheimer’s and was hospitalized in February after falling off a high stool at my Aunt K’s farm, who was her caretaker. We all thought for sure she’d be gone and I said my goodbyes in February, but she pulled through. AK is a nightmare - tried charging GD 5 years ago 5k a month for “assisted living care”, posted a video to FB of her daughter fucking around with my sister’s Uke as GD is wheezing in her literal deathbed in the background... I uninvited her 13 months before my wedding for her behavior toward my parents. She also got my grandma’s nursing home shut down. No longer in contact, but AK made things much harder. GD’s sister died a few weeks before her. D’s husband, my grandpa V passed in 1997.

My husband has lost important older family members this year as well. His close great uncle passed a few days ago. We’ve been married a few months now, so we are just starting to bond as a combined family. He’s been my guiding green light. 

My grandpa has been in and out of the hospital. 

Now my grandma S, who has bi-polar disorder but is otherwise cognitively all there is in the hospital. It’s triggered a manic episode and we have to keep a close eye to assure she gets the appropriate care, and there are already concerns about important tests being put off and discharged with a “wait and see”. 

Unlike GD, I’m very close to GS and am so worried. I’m also worried about my Grandpa. My dad keeps saying “it’s one of those times where a lot of people are dying and going to die at once”. My dad is an MD so it’s hard to blow off his pessimism regarding health. 

I’ve barely experienced death my whole life and now it comes up so often. Sometimes I look at my pets and tear up because I know I’ll have to watch them go someday.

She's dating my ex. It's a really weird story but basically they were dating for 6 weeks before we all realized who was who. I had not seen him in awhile, and encouraged her to date him as she had already fallen pretty hard for him at this point and I didn't want to get in the way of her happiness.

A little backstory - he and I dated very briefly over 5 years ago. He was incredible. Smart, kind, gorgeous, comes from a wealthy family, and he's great in bed. I ended it because my feelings did not match his. He was very clearly head over heels in love, wanted to marry me and start having kids asap. It freaked me out and I ghosted him. Due to mutual friends, we weren't out of each other's lives completely after that and he made it very clear that I had broken his heart and that he hated me. He dropped that when they started dating, kind of. 

6 months in they ""broke up"" but it was purely for scheduling conflicts as she travels for work and would be gone a lot this year. The whole time they were together his behavior toward me had been really weird and was affecting how our mutual friends treated me, so when they broke up I asked if he and I could talk. We met up in public, I said his behavior towards me was unacceptable & asked what was going on & he said in no uncertain terms ""if I am around you, I'm going to fall in love with you again."" I responded ""you know this puts me in a very uncomfortable position. I do not feel the same, and you need to not date my  friend."" He assured me that he did not want to be in love with me, that he wished he could turn off his feelings for me, and that they were no longer together. Obviously, the break up didn't take. Their relationship has progressed, they say I love you to each other now, and the other day she told me she thinks he is the one which is what brings me here. 

How can I talk to her about this? Part of me feels like I shouldn't say anything at all, just stay out of it as much as possible, maybe his feelings for me will dissipate & they'll live happily ever after. They're both incredible people, and deserve to be happy. But I cannot shake the feeling that if i called him right now and said ""i made a huge mistake, take me back"" he would drop her in a heartbeat and if I was in her shoes I would definitely want to know that.

I know she wanted to have sex but after the first time having sex with her, I became super nervous to do it again.

Other than the lack of sex, we did always do outercourse with each other almost everytime we went to cuddle in bed about once a week and we both loved it. We also had an amazing relationship outside of the sexual stuff. 

But I'm just wondering if she left me because there was a lack of sex? I understand she desired it but due to my anxiety with sex, I've always put it off (and no, I didn't tell her about my anxiety).

Me (27M) and my girlfriend(28F) have been in a relationship for about 10 years and have been living together a couple of years now. We had our ups and downs but most part of the relationship was good.

Bigger problems started a few months back, when I caught her in a lie on where she was staying. When we had a talk, she admited not staying at one friend's place, but at another (both were supposedly here schoolmates - female if it matters). I did not understand why she would lie about such a thing, since it doesn't make any difference to me if she stays with one or the other, I just care that she's safe and that she doesn't lie.. Nonetheless, even if I didn't believe her and even if I didn't understand why someone would lie about such a thing, I have decided to give her a second chance, as it really seemd to me that she was sorry.

But my problems start here, as she has shown that she is capable of lying, I'd be a fool to trust her blindly again. And to be honest, even if I decided to, I couldn't. Rebuilding trust takes time, if it even can be rebuilt.

So recently I did something very bad ... I couldn't help myself and I took a look at her google timeline. According to it she left work couple of hours early and was at a coffee place we used to go sometimes. The tracks weren't very accurate (I dont understand why,it seems like the gps signal was poor), but it clearly shows that she was at that place for a couple of hours and not at work. The place is couple of miles away from work. From there, the line shows directly home - as if she didn't drive home directly form work. I feel really bad for looking at it, so I have already logged out and I do not know her passwords, so I have no way of reentering.

161,e6oe0d,dsfvdh,1575583031.0,0,She (f 24) cheated (?) even thouth we weren't together. I'm (27M) trying to move past it.,"I made a post about this a couple days ago but I deleted it.  I think I'm in a better place now to describe this.

I met a girl back in early September.  She lived about 20 hours drive from me and it was her last day in the area.  We spent the night together, and she skipped her flight so we could spend the day and another night together.  Basically from that day on, I've felt like I'm always in a daze and thinking about her.  I've had a lot of relationships from casual to seriously, but the feelings I get with her are different.

We talked every day after that, did a road trip together, and have had about 4 visits over the last few months.  .  We started saying we love each other after the first night of the road trip which was about a month in. But on our last visit she told me that we can't be together.  It was a combination of things moving too fast, the distance, and a fear of getting so close with someone

In the end we lasted one day not talking and had a long talk about keeping things more casual, and we started talking every day again but fewer texts and not having a daily phone call anymore.  I also started holding back on telling her how I felt about her as often, just trying to treat her like more of a friend.  We did however agree that it was wrong to be with anyone else, and that we both wouldn't do that.  I trusted her completely.  But I could tell she was conflicted and I could telling something was off.  I compensated for this by backing off further, to show her I could handle some space.  

She told me over the weekend she slept with a guy the prior night.  He was an ex who has hit her up a few times since we met but she always ignored until this time.  She says she has no feelings for him, she regrets it, she hated every part of it, and that the reason she did it was to hurt me.  She did it to kill our relationship since she didn't think she had the willpower to end it herself.  She has a lot of past trauma from a lot of things that I don't want to share for someone else, but sex and relationships are a huge stressor.

I don't know what to do.  We've talked a few times.  I've already told her I still love her and I think its true. I can't help it.  But last night we kind of fell into a phone conversation where we were just talking as if nothing had happened. She was telling me all these things she missed that I did when we're in bed together and I enjoyed it at first, but then images of her with him started popping up.  I told her this, and I hung up. I think I need at least a couple weeks no contact but I can't make it over a day.  I can't ignore her. And if she doesn't break the silence I can't make it long without doing it myself. 

My questions are pretty much endless as far as what is wrong with me, what are my viable options, how long do I need to not communicate to make a good decision.",relationship_advice

For some background info I haven’t been able to keep food down that’s how down I’m feeling about all this.

I’m [17m] and I just had a talk with my SO about us like two hours ago, it needed to happen. My parents had been on my case for a while and they’ve probably manipulated me into thinking this way because they hate my SO. They are crazy helicopters and it’s really messed me up, but this is what I said to them.

SO I’m sorry, I’m not sure that I’m right for you. I’m being torn apart because my parents are going to kill me just for taking to you but I don’t want to lose you. At this point I think letting you go might be the best thing I can do you. You already have a full plate, and a you can’t have a healthy relationship with an unhealthy person. I’m sorry, I don’t want to hurt you though. I know why I’m so cuddly right now,  it’s because it makes me forget about everything else going on. I’m sorry I should’ve just told you I couldn’t ever be right for you from the start, but I was hoping I would be good enough for once in my life I would be.

They told me it was all right and that they would always be there for me, if not my SO but as my friend.

I broke down and cried in their arms, and told them I love them and they said the same.

I’m just wondering what I should do now, we are going to have a conversation tomorrow about us but I don’t want to let them go. Help, what do I do now?

166,e6obs0,alarmsurprise,1575582789.0,2,"Wife cheated, lied, hid STI","Advanced warning: This is a VERY long and nuanced one, and this is about as abridged as I can make it, apologies in advance.

I've (33M) been married to my wife (29F) for 3.5 years, and together almost 7 years. A couple of days after our anniversary this year (May) she went on a business trip to a different city. She said that she had intended to meet up with a male friend for food after the trip, to which I consented. When she got home, I noticed that there were subtle behaviours that felt “off”, which came to a head a couple of days later when we were visiting my nephew, who had been seriously ill with something the doctors were struggling to diagnose. She was in a text conversation with someone, and kept angling away from me whilst in the conversation.

I felt this was a bit strange so, the next day, I sneaked a look at her phone when she went to the bathroom. I found a very graphic conversation via Twitter direct message (no images, but talking very graphically). I only had a few seconds, so I couldn’t get the whole context. Got a friend to text me with an emergency so I could get out of the house and clear my head. He advised that, whilst it didn’t look good, I didn’t get the whole picture, and I should probably try to get another look before confronting her. That night, I woke up earlier (around 4am) and looked at her phone again, seeing that she’d deleted the direct messages. She hadn’t, however, deleted the email notifications, so I found those and confronted her.

She had no defence, and fell on her sword. I learned that the sex that they had was unprotected, and she slipped up and said that she had intended to sleep with me the next day (I’ve had a vasectomy, so we don’t use protection). She refused to talk to anyone to get support initially, and there were indications that she was thinking about hurting herself, so the next few days were agonising whilst I had to be the person to watch over her whilst simultaneously being the person who she had hurt. She eventually opened up to some close family and friends, relieving the pressure from me immensely.

We had some VERY difficult conversations over the next few weeks, exploring what had gone wrong, and I learned some quite difficult and disturbing things that had happened in her upbringing. She also mentioned that one of the “reasons” was that I didn’t seem as sexually interested in her as she would like. I noted that, in our relationship, I was the one who initiated sex 99.9% of the time, which had led me to feel unattractive and unwanted, making me less inclined to initiate as time went on (general frequency tended to be once a week).

Ultimately, we decided to work on it on two conditions: she was never to have any contact with this person again, and that she would seek counselling. I told her that I don’t particularly care if he’s not blocked on her profiles, but to block and unblock him to break the connection on things like Twitter and Instagram (I had sent the man’s wife/mother of his infant child a message with pictures of the messages, so I knew she was concerned about a s**t storm heading her way and would want some warning). I also saw a counsellor to work through my difficulties in this time.

Things seemed to improve, but then she went on another business trip (different city, he wasn’t there), and I noticed that they were following each other again on Instagram. I confronted her about it, and said that she must have ‘accidentally’ followed him, and that she didn’t realise that I wanted her to stop him from following her in the first place. I was (I think understandably) dissatisfied with this answer, as I was very explicit with the block-unblock thing, but she would not budge, and there was nowhere for the argument to go. I moved out to a hotel for a few days, with the proviso that she would move out for a few days when I got back. Somehow, I couldn’t tell you how, things improved again, and we tried to work on it.

We had a few months where things almost got back to normal; in truth some of our happiest months, having been more open about issues within our relationship, and then she went on another business trip. The phone network we both use went down whilst she was away (without any warning or even acknowledgement by the company), and I freaked out a bit, not being able to contact her, or locate her on a GPS app we have both had for years (she has a tendency to think that I’ve died if ever she has trouble getting hold of me). I looked up the man that she had slept with, and he was in the same city at an event very close by. When able to contact her again, I (calmly) gave her the benefit of the doubt, and texted her saying that I know that he’s there, and has she had any contact from him. She said she hadn’t, which either meant that he didn’t know she was there, or that he didn’t want to contact her, either of which was fine with her. I normalised the text conversation for the rest of the day, knowing that me asking about him would likely put her on edge.

As I think is understandable, the idea was difficult to shake, so the next morning I checked her location for the previous evening, and saw that after the work event, she went on a bit of a bar crawl making her way back to her hotel, and then shot across the city to a different hotel between 11:30pm and 12:40am. I phoned that hotel in the morning just before their checkout time, asking if I could “get a message to my colleague” who stayed there, giving the surname of the man she cheated on me with. They confirmed his whole name, saying that he had already checked out that morning.

I gave her the benefit of the doubt again (there were two conferences in that city, and limited hotel space – she could have legitimately been with other colleagues), asking what she had done that evening, and she just repeatedly said that she had been to a few bars, but they were too loud and she went back to her hotel at 1am. The next morning I checked her phone again, and there was a phone call to him just before she went over there.

I hit the roof, and she firstly tried to make me feel bad for snooping (I’ll get to that in a bit), before saying she did see him with the intention of asking him to block me because she felt we couldn’t move on if I was still checking up on him. I didn’t buy that, as I don’t think that needed a meeting at his hotel for over an hour, and could have been done via text, plus I would have noticed that he suddenly blocked me. I ended the relationship, and spoke to my family about all of this for the first time (I didn’t want to cause a rift between them that they may not be able to fix if I was ultimately able to get past this). She moved out into a temporary place she found on AirBNB, and has since moved back in after finding a flat to rent in the longer term. Things have been strange, because they almost seem normal whilst we are living together again until you suddenly realise that they’re not, and I don’t think it’s given either us real time to process our feelings. She has admitted since I blew up that she ""kissed him goodbye"".

To complicate matters even further, my wife has admitted to me within the last 2 days that she had been hiding the fact that she has genital herpes from me for the majority of our relationship. She claimed that this was the reason why she had not been as open sexually over the years, and why she had declined at some times. I’ve never had any symptoms, so I may have been very lucky with that, but I haven’t had myself tested (yet). Not only does this make me feel VERY uncomfortable that she hid a highly contagious STD from me for years, but to then have also not mentioned that at all when I opened up to her about how her not seeming sexually interested in me is incredibly hurtful.

Regarding my snooping through her phone: I’m entirely aware that this is a very toxic behaviour, and it’s something that I am very ashamed of doing. Considering that I’ve found evidence of cheating and lying through this method, I’m personally of the opinion that mine is the lesser of two “evils”, but it’s proven to me that elements of this relationship have turned me into a person I don’t want to be.

I also realise that this must sound like just a rant, but my conundrum is this – I truly love this woman, unconditionally. I want her to have a happy life, and she claims the same is true in reverse (as difficult as it may seem to believe, I think she believes that too). She is clearly very troubled, and I’m the only one who knows her whole story (save any further surprises that I’m not aware of), so there’s a large part of me that wants to help her. I should note that this has had a massive detrimental effect on my mental health; I’ve been suffering with suicidal thoughts, and have been seen by my local hospital’s crisis team twice throughout this. I suppose my question is this - would I be doing more harm than good in the long run trying to help her work through her issues?

TL:DR – My wife cheated, acted suspiciously afterwards and eventually broke the first condition of us working on the relationship. Told me she hid that she had herpes from me for almost the entirety of our relationship. I love her, want the best for her, struggling with the disparity of being best placed to help whilst being treated terribly.",relationship_advice

But also, just in any person. She’s unlike any other person, biased, but it’s true. 

She is going to college in less than 8 months. We have wishes to be together for as long as time permits us, and both seriously envision a future together. 

I know she wants to go away, and I have no issue with that, as I want to get out of my city, and used what is saved to move for personal training as well as community college. 

We’ve talked about It, me coming with, and she doesn’t know, which I can’t blame. Hell, I don’t know. But what I do know is we both wish for that to happen. But if it can’t, we would be forced to part, which would be... rather painful, but I know I can get through anything. She has the idea of a 4 year break and reconnecting after, which I don’t see happening. Call me pessimistic but 4 years is a long time, and she and I are both movers, and don’t let ourselves stay down. And would not do long distance. I would do anything to not lose her, but I will accept whatever comes. 

My question, what do I do? How can I stop overthinking so much, and just the time I have with her. Whether it be limited, or a lifetime. I just don’t want to think about it. But it makes it hard to find my passion and enthusiasm and positivity when all I can think about is how she’s going to go, so why be with her? And my mind goes bad places, and I hate that.

I had constant thoughts of suicide and I was serious insecurity, and self confidence issues.  I had dated the same girl for over 6 years and it seemed like at the end we were only together because of the amount of time we had devoted to our relationship.  I had become very stagnant in our relationship and didn't do anything to make her feel special, I was often rude and unnecessarily cold towards her.  One night she went out with a friend and when she came back we talked and she told me she decided she wanted to break up.  It was kind of a shock because in my complacency I believed that I couldn't lose her and when all of a sudden she was gone I didn't know what to do.

We broke up and didn't talk for about a month, then we started talking again and she wanted to come see me and how I was doing so she came to my house and I tried really hard to show her affection thinking that we could still get back together and make things work.  It went really well and we both felt like things did when they were good.  But at the end of the visit she got a call from her mom saying that she was diagnosed with cancer.  It was in the late stages when they caught it and things declined quickly.  During the following months her mother was declining quickly, she wouldn't eat and became so frail.  I tried many times during the months this was all happening to reach out to my ex and offer any help I could, even just to talk but I didn't get much back.  I didn't force myself into the situation because I didn't think it was my place.  Eventually her mother was moved into the hospital, and soon after she died to the cancer that had invaded her body.

When her mother had died, she didn't tell me and I found out from another mutual friend of ours.  I was devastated, and didn't know what to do or say.  I had a great relationship with her mother and I am in disbelief of how fast this happened and that it happened at all.  Our mutual friend told me that my ex did not want to see me at the funeral and so I didn't go.  I took the day off work that day and stayed home because I couldn't handle the flood of emotions I was feeling.  Her mom had been so kind to me for years and had called me her son, but she is gone now and I can't grieve, I have no one to talk to about it, and those I have talked to about it just tell me to get over it because me and my ex aren't even together anymore so why am I letting it bother me still.

It is now over 4 months since she passed and I think about my ex and her mother nearly everyday.  I have become very jaded and I don't know how to process my feelings right now.  I work in customer service so I put on a fake version of me everyday, I don't feel like me anymore.   I am struggling with whether I should tell all this to my ex or to leave it and find another outlet so I am posting here.  I have lost family members of my own in the past but this hurts so much deeper because she was like a mother to me and I never got to say goodbye in any way.

Currently the biggest effect is her working off the clock unpaid 5-10 hours a week, and taking no lunches or breaks to use the restroom. The thing is it isn't her supervisors asking her, it's her clients, she sets her own schedule every week more or less, her supervisors tell her not to work off the clock and would be upset to learn she is doing this. I wouldn't have an issue with this except for the stress of this causes her to have mental breakdowns, is contributing to her self-harming, and results in her getting angry at me frequently. 

 She works social services and the things she does with her clients is important, but not life and death typically, a large portion is trips to the grocery store, trips to the liquor store, trips to can redemption, her clients have and are plenty capable of taking the bus, they do so when she is not available. I have mentioned to her this is not selflessness, it is just a total lack of self-respect. Before she and others were hired clients were only seen about once a month, now most are seen weekly, everyone survived when she department was the same amount of clients but had half the staff members. 

Twice this week so far have been mental breakdowns at midnight from not being able to finish her work for the day. Day in and day out for the last year this has happened, when I ask why she keeps working off the clock when it has such an emotional effect on her, she just says she has to and I don't get any answer to why she feels this way. She doesn't. No one is having her work off the clock besides herself, if her supervisors knew they would be upset, she is putting driving someone so they don't have to take the bus above her own well being. I just always thought this behavior would change but it hasn't. It was doing everything for friends who treated her poorly, now it is doing everything for clients who treat her bad. We have been together two years and I don't know if I can stay with her if she continues to treat herself this way. I love her but it is exhausting to watch and I can't watch someone self-sabotage and treat themselves like shit my whole life. I know I shouldn't but I have been excusing how I have been negatively treated due to the stress she is under for the last two years. More and more I feel all the stress she is under is completely self-inflicted. I feel like a punching bag. 

The advice I'm asking is how do I bring this up to her? However I think of bringing up being unable to continue this way in our relationship sounds like an ultimatum to me.

172,e6o7oz,ThrowRAalhil,1575582331.0,2,I (18F) saw my boyfriend (19M) and one of his bestfriends (19?F) kiss and I am not sure how to bring it up.,"So over the weekend we were at a party the his really good friend was throwing. We were all pretty.... way drunk. And towards the end of the night the host goes up to my boyfriend and says what I am pretty sure was, ""thanks so much for coming."" then gives him a kiss. It was just a peck but it was on the lips. We both went home shortly after (him before me) and in my state I didn't really fully comprehend what I say until the next morning.

&#x200B;

We haven't talked about it since and as far as I am aware he has no idea that I saw. He seems to be feeling really guilty but that could just be my own wishful interpretation, but he is definitely acting differently and a lot more quiet. I am not really sure how to write out all my thoughts on the situation so I am just going to do bullets for everything.

&#x200B;

\- Him and his very good friend kissed

&#x200B;

\- It wasn't really his fault she just kinda went for it

&#x200B;

\- She walked away immediately after and they didn't seem to say another word to each other the rest of the night (which wasn't that long)

&#x200B;

\- He hasn't admitted it happened to me, or apologized for it

&#x200B;

\- His behavior seems to point to guilt that he is feeling

&#x200B;

\- (this is the really weird one that is making it so I don't just approach him about it) looking back on it, I think it was kinda hot....

&#x200B;

Now I should talk to him and figure out what is going on. Did it mean something to him? And he is wondering how to break it off with me? Did it just blind side him and his is too scared to admit what happened? Does he not even know what it means to him and still trying to work that out? The easy solution would be to have the tough conversation and bring it up to him. But I don't even know my own emotions right now. I should be mad at her for kissing him. But I am not. I should be mad at him for not telling me. But I'm not. I'm definitely straight and I am definitely monogamous so why did I find that hot? 

&#x200B;

So I guess, what advice do you have for figuring out my own emotions? Or should I talk to him before I figure out my own shit? I just feel like the answer should be obvious but I have no idea what it is or what I should do.

Recently he's gotten busier, taking on a second job and starting some classes again so our sex life has taken a bit of a hit but we still make time for sex as often as possible. We don't live together yet but we do see each other 5-6 days a week and when we aren't together he still keeps in touch and really only goes radio silent for an hour at maximum - usually saying that he was napping or studying, and I believe him. He's never cheated on any of his ex-girlfriends or ever mentioned being unfaithful in any way. I trust him (almost) wholeheartedly - we don't use condoms and never have. We did get tested for STIs before ever having sex.

This week I didn't see him on Monday because road conditions were bad and he really needed to study. On Tuesday I saw him right after work, then we went to the gym together and had sex later on that night. When I went down on him I could faintly smell latex. I didn't ask him about it because in the moment I didn't know how to mention it without it coming across as accusatory so I just went along with having sex with him. He usually lasts longer when he's recently orgasmed, but that day he probably only lasted 4 minutes which is normal for him after going a few days without sex - so I'm not sure if the smell was all in my head; if he had had sex with someone else with a condom on, surely he wouldn't have only lasted 4 minutes, right? Am I being paranoid? If this happens again, how do I mention it without making him feel like I'm accusing him of anything?",relationship_advice
175,e6o6ou,Catiicorn,1575582218.0,1,What do I do?,"(DISCLAIMER) this is a really long and complicated story but I hope that if you read it all through it'll make more sense (also fake names to make the story easier to read)

Hi so I have this friend of mine we have been friends for almost 3 years (Jason) I met him through another person that I was into at the time. Her name was (Emily) She basically asked me to tell me an inside joke between the 2 of them and that's when it started. We had been talking very friendly ect and so we went to an event with Jason Emily and some other people, I confessed to her that I liked her and got my heart shattered. And then Jason was there to support me, and he quickly became my support through cuddles ect and just in general being there for me (also a quick side note that's important Jason is currently suffering with depression because of stress from school that he got from he's ADD he didn't know he had at this time so at this time I didn't notice it at all other than things I'll get into later)

So I honestly don't remember exactly what happens next but we got into a fight and we stopped talking for a while. At this time we had tried dating because I truly loved him and cared for him, but we stopped talking for anywhere around 6-8 months then I saw him on my way to school and got a huge panic attack and I decided to text him, saying I saw him (his depression was getting really bad at this time but still going to school because it still hasn't hit) we started talking again and I we kind of just talked, then it happened again. 

Then I met someone, someone I dated for over 8 months that I really thought I loved, but that was a fail (at this time he had dropped out of school because he found out he had depression, I'm unsure when it happened though but he had definitely been done for over 4 months) and like when I was dating this guy I kept texting jason because I was so upset constantly and I didn't feel like I wasn't doing right in the relationship. But yeah I got single again, 2 days later I went to his place and we had sex (I had known him for about the 3 years but unsure?) He become my security again but I could tell he was different his depression makes it hard for him to stay with people for a very long time no matter who, but he loved my company. Jason and I had some time on and off until he got a huge dose of vitam D in his system which was obviously made him more awake and he just got addicted to me for a while.

So that was that for a while it was so amazing seeing him switch and become a true version of himself to fight that stupid idiot fucking with his brain but then I was an idiot. He really cares for me and I truly believe he does but I honestly hate myself (which I'm really trying to work on now) but he just got really mad and wouldn't talk to me if I was being a douchebag and I never even once thought about how he felt I just wanted to put my crap on him because I trust him so much but yeah I did it again for the millionth of time and now he doesn't wanna talk to me, which I understand why. I feel so shit about since I love him so much but I made a big promise to myself that I wouldn't get in contact with him before I got better, mentally and physically being able to take care of myself.

Here's the problem though, I want to see other people but I can't because the only thing I can think about is I wish this was Jason, I wish this was him, I just wanna cuddle him, kiss him, touch him. My brain refuses to move on. But what happens when I have recovered?

178,e6o47g,symbotic,1575581940.0,0,Should girlfriend [28F] want to spend New Years Eve with me [29M]?,"I've been dating my girlfriend nearly 5 months. In October we became ""official"" and on the very same day we became official (she initiated the conversation) she also booked a flight to Hawaii with her girlfriends for the first week of January. This was the day after we had a pretty serious conversation about spending time together, since she has been super busy out of town with previous commitments to friends (pretty much every weekend I'd known her).

She texted me about it during the day (before I knew that later that night she was planning on asking me to be her official boyfriend), saying that ""she was interested in going but didn't want to disappoint me."" I was not going to say, ""No, don't go."" and she had already bought the ticket anyway, saying that she could cancel it. So even though it was nice she considered me I don't really think I had a say in the matter.

At the time I didn't really consider that she was flying out on New Years Eve. Fast forward to this week and I asked her about it to get some more details and she said she was leaving New Years Eve. This made me kind unsettled and sad... I would of course really want to spend New Years Eve with my girlfriend... it seems really significant and important to me.

She's mentioned she can change the flight to New Years Day, but it seems kind of unreasonable for me to ask that of her. I brought up being a little saddened that we won't spend NYE together and she said, ""well i booked it before we were boyfriend/girlfriend"" which doesn't make much sense to me because she brought it up that very night that she wanted to be official... so before we were boyfriend/girlfriend by literally hours.

She also told me that she feels bad about it and wishes that she didn't book the flight on that day and/or considered me more. 

I'm not sure how to go forward. I don't want to make a big deal out of this and get angry but I'm feeling a bit hurt. I don't want to ask her to change the flight either. So what now? Just let it go? Do I ask her to follow through on her suggestion of changing the flight by one day?

I have always wanted to moved in together because we live in different towns and I'm tired of all the travelling every weekend. But he was always against it saying it's too soon. So we agreed on a year. His reasoning was always ""it's too soon"" but also shows signs of commitment issues like me telling him some deeply private information about my feelings about him and his paralysis and lack of response.

My background: I come from a war torn country and have been a refugee my whole life in my own land. This made me feel like I never belong anywhere, no country or city or people. I have friends that helped me through it, but I could never shake the feeling of  being an imposter.

We have started moving in mid November and I'm still at my old place until I sort everything out. However, he has been talking about changing apartments for months now and never really got around to it. Today he talked to his mom and she said she found a nice place and that he should go check it out. Later today he said he will go check an apartment on Monday.

I realise this sound petty and please tell me if it is. But I felt hurt that he didn't think of asking me to go look at the apartment with him. Since this is where is would move into in a couple of months as well. Of course we will share rent. So I think if we are together and serious for so long that he should have thought of me when considering. Now I feel like a parasite and leech. When I confronted him and asked why didn't you ask me to go with you at all, he first said oh it's a Monday so you won't be here (I don't work every other monday so he could have asked) and then said I didn't even think to ask.

I have said that Im looking to have a relationship but he seems apprehensive, Im afraid to keep on the subject but am afraid Im falling in love alone.

He works 5 days a week then when free gets reallllllly loose with booze at local bars with his friends Friday night thru Sunday afternoon.

Hes a very nice guy. He seems insecure but sweet & has a hard time being comfortable with me(as I can see) but with each beer he gets more open.

On 3-5 occasions he's been real deep in the booze & professes his love for me. He says Im what he wants, he loves me and that he wants to marry me. He asks me to say it back but the timing isnt real (I want it to be) Its wonderful & I want to say it back but I dont...drunk or not.

I tell him my feelings & say Id love him to be so honest when he's sober. I know that if he was & said what he does when hes drunk I would say it back

HOWEVER...when sober he recalls nothing (or so he says) & also apologises (which makes me a little sad) Its VERY hard for me, a girl interested in growing with him, to get 2 different guys

As much as his binge drinking hurts him and makes me worry, he is the guy I like drunk & I wonder where that man goes sober.

My brother (M17) would be driven to school at 8:00AM and usually then my mom would drive to work after dropping him off. My boyfriend wanted to come over and I told him to come at 8:15 because no one would be home. While we were having sex, after 30 minutes my mom walks up the stairs and says ""What are you doing"" in the most annoyed voice. What was so awkward was that my mom and I made eye contact while my boyfriend was doing missionary on me. My mom is at work and I get home at 12AM tonight because of work, but I can't avoid her forever. My dad knows I had sex and my brother also walked in on us a week ago (sorry brother) so her ratting me out isn't a problem. I just feel super awkward about it.

Also when my boyfriend and I got caught, he didn't seem phased by it. Is it normal to feel a little offended that he didn't care that I just got caught by my mom? I mean, I told him that my parents don't have a problem with it, but if his mom walked in on us I would feel super bad. I will say that my boyfriend did feel super bad when my brother walked in on us. Why not my mom?

When you got caught by a parent, what did you say to your mom? Is it normal to feel a little bothered that your SO doesn't feel bad for having their girlfriend's parent catch them having sex? Does anyone have any stories like this? I'd love to hear!

We've been on and off for a while because we didn't fall out of love at all in the breakup, she just had a lot of trust issues because she jumped from her ex girlfriend to me pretty fast. I worked through a lot of her pain and we made so much progress but in the end our breakup had nothing to do with not having love for each other, she just should have taken more time after her ex who broke her emotionally. 

Fast forward to before Thanksgiving a couple weeks ago. My ex is casually dating someone and it kills me to see because she's gotten REALLY close to this person really fast. I know I shouldn't care, but it's the first person I've seen her bring everywhere. We live in a pretty small big city, so the queer community is very tiny. I am jealous about seeing this girl around and it obviously is killing me. Around the same time, a mutual friend of my ex and I (let's call her Jane) told me she likes me. She's been there the entire time my ex and I dated, but she told me she only recently started to be attracted to me.

Jane and I finally hook up a few times and I do it because I know my ex has been hooking up with her new girl and I just got upset and kinda just said fuck it I wanna have fun and forget my ex and Jane is here and is attracted to me. A week later (week of Thanksgiving) my ex tells me she's not seeing the girl she's seeing anymore because of the new girl's anger issues and she didn't feel comfortable. My ex and I are talking and hanging again(I know that sounds like she's jumping between us and I recognize I should have more fortitude) and I think about how I don't want to harbor this secret.

I told her this morning I hooked up with Jane and I regretted it and just did it for stupid attention and fun. My ex had a MELTDOWN about it. Blew up, told me I'm disgusting, and the friend is disgusting, says she never wants me back and never wants to talk to me again. She said she claimed Jane to be so close and be like family to her or a best friend, and I had NO clue about how close they got. To me, Jane was just a clubbing/casual friend. I shouldn't assume everyone's relationships with their friends are the same. I just know my ex and I didn't tell each other every little detail since our breakup so I had no clue her and Jane got closer as friends. I just wanted to tell her so we don't rebuild without everything on the table or because she asked, I just wanted her to know the truth but she's so broken and hurt.

I’ve lost a lot of time, but I’ve spent the last several months making up for it - I am home, I am present, I am part of the family, I help out at home, all while maintaining the work I normally do.

We’ve been together nine years and in the time since she fell pregnant, we have found little time for little dates or outings, and I feel this (as well as her work stress and our little one) may be a primary factor in the way she is feeling.

She has been on my back telling me I need to tell the lady I work with that I am coming back for the winter. I hate this job and I am ready to leave. I have done my time at this place and plan to get an internship in the summer or just a different job.

Her is where the issue is. I have finals soon and then once finals are over, 1 week after that is Christmas and the day after that I am leaving for vacation. It feels almost pointless to force myself to work for like 6 days, when I will be finishing finals, to work, to pack, to leave.

I know my Mom will give me shit probably for this just bc that is how she is. I hate to lie but the only way I am going to get it through her head is to make something up like say that I am doing something at the University like working, to get her off my back. I will go back to this restaurant to work, but I won't be going back until after I get back.

In the meantime my plan is to just lie and say I am working in the school library or something, or volunteering for the first week or whatever to just make it so she can't get mad at me for just wanting a few days to relax before break. I feel and about it but honestly I need to do it to allow me stress relief and to keep her off my back.

Title is the problem really, but there needs to be some background to this:

I (25m) met my ex six years ago, while i was more or less busy with my Bachelors. She just finished Highschool and was just starting her studies in a very difificult Science field at a university close to her. So after about half a year of long distance relationship, i moved into a teeny tiny apartememt close to her (and her familys) home. Because my flat was so small, during the weekends (and more often than not a lot of weekdays as well) i practically moved in with her family; her parents and her little sister, who is two years younger than her. Everything was dandy for the first year: Her parents accepted me as a part of the family, we went on trips to places we wanted to visit and i felt like it was the best time in my life so far.

In 2016 everything started to unravel for me. My ex was more and more caught up in her studies in a field i couldnt grasp orfind much excitement for and thus always stuedied. Always. While i sat through many a week night to be free of my then Masters work she'd spent the weekend sitting in front of her laptop and some graphs and chemical data. So I started to spend more and more time with her sister instead. We sat together in the living room reading books, binge watching LOTR or some other stuff or just talking to each other about all the topics that came to our heads. She is a quiet one and likes to stay inside with a book and some tea, but after some time i felt like I was one of the very few pleople she opened up to. We shared so many things it was almost funny: we both listened to the same kinds of music, we could talk about history and archeology for hours. I also started to notice how properly beautiful she is. The more time went by being frustrated about the lack of proper interaction with my ex, the more i felt myself drawn to her sister. 

This dragged on for a looooong time and i grew more and more unhappy without really knowing why. The relationship with my ex startec to noticibly cool as well.  Until one evening i came out of the bathromm and turned right to ger into my exes room i realised that i much, much rather liked to go left to her sister. Things escalated from there on. My ex and I grew more and more grumpy with each other while i only looked foreard to spent more time with her sister. Who became ever more friendly towards me. Because i could never voice my affections to her except as a joke that went over everybodies head i gently started poking her in the side, in her legs etc. I just wanted to touch her, be close to her. And she started to poke me back and it became a bit of a game between us. Things like that and things like her coming out of the shower in front of me with just panties and a towel caused me to languish everytime i couldnt be with her.

In early 2018 my ex and I broke up. The relationship was stonecold by then but there was another thing that broke her: I had lied to them. I had lied to them about my family and where i was from, how i grew up and all that. Made up an elaborate story to mask that i didnt feel connected to my family so that in my mind, my exes family would accept me rather than think of me not fit to be a family man. In hindsight that was the worst and most destructive thing i ever did in my life. Even after i was essentially part of their family i couldnt tell them the truth because i was too afraid too lose them over it, too lose her over it. And as everyone not completly caught up with themselves could have guessed it, thats exactly what happened. While the parents understood and even supported me in a very difficult time for me, my ex broke all contact (This was after we broke up). Her sister, now im the same university as me tried to give me a chance. We met up several times over the year that followed and each time it got quietermas i could see the trust go away while i sat there with so much to say to her but i never had the strength to say anything. The last time i saw her and we talked was this year on valentines day when me met at the station on the way home. For half an hour i sat next to her and couldnt say a word. I wanted to tell her ehy i lied to her, what she means to me.

Later i did the thing only teens normally do and confessed my feelings to her via text. At this point she already said before that she didnt want to meet up again so i was desperate and hoped i would feel better if at least it was out after it simmered for so many years. She blocked me without responding and that was the last time i had contact with her. I know i must have hurt her much more than i thought i did.

And tbis is pretty much where im standing now. I made some instagram alts to follow her stories which probanly was a mistake but still after nearly a year of no contact my feelings havent changed, i still want to be with her, i want to see her happy. I want to be back on the couch with her talking about the weirdest things while we poke us back and forth. She might have been the one i could have been truly happy with bad bad circumstamces with her being my exes sister and my lying just ruined that.

And yet i still feel the need to reach out, to go and drive to their house and stand in front of the door until she comes out and talk to me and how do i just make that stop? She creeps into my thoughts everyday for the simplest of reasons and this obsession with her is ruining my life. I had a brief afgair with a very nice girl who wanted to deepen our relationship but i couldnt and slowly pushed her away just because i could not get her to linger in the back of my mind and wishing it would have been her.

I dont know if anyone actually bothers to read all this, i just needed to get this of my chest.
But any kind of help a stranger on the internet coild give me would be appreciated.

194,e6nvac,vivitii,1575580926.0,1,My crush (26M) gave me (22F) his email address to keep in touch,"Long story short, I have a huge crush on this guy who I work with. Unfortunately, Iam leaving the company and the country - so not great. (Temporarily)

On my last day I said goodbye to all of my colleagues and he was one of them. After teasing me quite a bit he gave me his email address and he said: if you ever need anything contact me. 

Now.... I dont know how to take this. We had a friendly professional relationship. We would laugh a lot together and we would sort of banter/ tease each other. He tends to giggle/ laugh a lot when he is around me. I do too (but thats because he makes me nervous from being so damn cute). At the same time, when we work together he stays really focused and behaves professionally. When we spoke he said that I  didnt like him at first- and he sensed that. (Which is obviously not true). At some point when I joked that he didnt like me, he said: Nah, I'm indifferent. 

On the one hand, he hasn't given out his email address to anyone else. But... if you want to keep in touch with someone, you would give them your social media account, right? 

So I'm sort of torn. I dont know if he likes me or not. If he geniunely wants to keep in touch. I think that if I dont send him an email I'm probably never going to hear from him again. If I do  I dont know if he will respond. And honestly I dont know what to email him. ""Hi, its ""such and such"" I literally said goodbye to you 3 days ago, but I really want to hear from you, so I'm sending you this email which is obviously meant to get your attention. Please love me"". 

Yeah I'm clueless- I don't know how to handle this situation. What to email him, if I should email him at all. Please help me 😭😭😭",relationship_advice

Things got off to a rocky start, she just moved back into her moms house after a bad 5 year break up and has no job or car. She had extreme trust issues in the beginning, got passive aggressive when I talked to my friends and didn’t like me going out. That was a huge no for me, and so I broke things off. She texted me a week later addressing all of her toxic behaviors and let me know she was gonna work on getting into therapy. She has a drinking problem, often taking up to 5 shots a day in secret which has torn me up but she listened to my concerns and has cut back on her drinking (i believe) which I so appreciated. She also didn’t like my best friend and made it known, which was also a huge no for me since he’s the most important person in my life. But she took steps to hang out with him and get over the jealousy. Anyways, rocky start, however I truly feel like this is the woman I could marry. I trust her with my life, and over the past few months I’ve fallen madly in love with her. I feel like she’s my other half, an extension of me. She has extreme anxiety and depression and I’ve been doing my best to help her without getting my own emotions mixed up in it. She treats me so well and is completely committed to me, I’ve never had a doubt in my mind that she will stay devoted to me and work to make the relationship last. I feel more myself when I’m with her. 
ANYWAYS, today she left her phone open and I saw that she has been sexting a man for money. I was shocked. This is never something I would have expected from her. Sending him pictures of herself with sex toys that I’ve bought for her, texting and calling a few times a week. I’m completely thrown. I know people do what they have to do for money, but the fact that she kept it a secret from me and worked to hide it. This isn’t the first time my trust has been broken with her. Am I too gullible? Does this sound like something I should have gotten out of months ago? She’s in such a horrible place right now but can’t help herself, she absolutely hates herself and no matter what I do I can’t show her how beautiful and capable she is. I love her so much but I’m so hurt. She would get jealous if I even mentioned past relationships and would shut down, and now I find out she’s been having sexual text/phone relations with some guy??

200,e6nrru,ThrowRAgtsk124,1575580543.0,2,Stubborn wife and sleep apnea,"Throw away because wife is a lurker. 

So my wife of 5 years has terrible sleep apnea.  She snores super loud, and it keeps me up most nights.  Her snoring has been an issue since before we got married (about 7 years together) and the sleep apnea had been happening (and worsening) over the past two years. 

For the last two years, I have been expressing my concerns about her stopping breathing in her sleep, and almost weekly asked her to please go and get a sleep study done.  She fought and fought it, saying things like ""how do you know I have sleep apnea, are you a doctor?"" and  telling me she's fine, that she knows her body etc.  After a year of pleading, she finally got a sleep study.

Doctor sent her home with this machine, and all these electrodes she had to stick on her body.  That night she put it all on, and brought it back to the doc the next day. End result, her doctor told her she has mild sleep apnea.  She had to wear this dental appliance that moves her jaw forward.  It helped alot, for the first week. She gave up on it after two, saying it hurts her jaw and that it takes an entire day to recover from the soreness.  

Also, some nights are worse than others with her apnea.  Sometimes it only happens a few times; other times she stops breathing for about 8-10 seconds followed by a crazy gasp for air, heavy panting and process repeats for the majority of the night.  

I've recorded her and played it back for her.  I've pleaded with her to go back and get another study. I've asked if I could come to the doc with her and talk to her doctor to describe what it's like and potentially show the doctor some recordings I have of this.  Every time, I'm met with dismissal, and some form of "" I don't know what I'm talking about"". 

So my question is, how the heck do I get through to her?? I've tried everything to express my concern, but it's always dismissed.  I end up sleeping downstairs and not in the same bed alot.",relationship_advice

Around the same time she was telling me about a male friend of hers and how they've been getting along and getting drinks soon and how interesting he is. 

She says he's in a relationship, but the way she talked and some of the things she said about how interesting he was made me wonder. I don't know what they talk about or do together except that she sends him hearts and winks and talks to him all the time and thinks he's super interesting. 

Anyway, I like to communicate and given the context I wanted to ask her about this friend in case I was misinterpreting. She responded really, really angrily and started swearing at me, so I'm wondering if I am being an asshole or if my message is accusatory. I'm kind of socially daft, so I'd appreciate anyone's opinion on this message and if it's accusing or warrants anger:


""I also wanted to ask... Maybe I'm just being insecure and silly, but I'd rather be open and just ask you.

204,e6nqtd,hub8900,1575580426.0,1,How do I deal with my boyfriend’s rude friends?,"I’m gonna try and make this as short and clear as possible so bare with me.

My boyfriend has had these two friends he met at work a few years ago. Us four have hung out for a while now, like every week or so, whether it’s drinks or games etc. One of the guys would occasionally bring his girlfriend and she was super nice and we’ve never had problems. So, this past year the 2nd guy started dating this girl. I got the vibe from the first impression that she is one of those people who thinks they’re above others. I tried not to make that judgement off of one impression, but after a couple, it was pretty clear to me that she wasn’t interested in taking the time to get to know me or my boyfriend. I also noticed that when she wasn’t around the guy acted more comfortable in conversations, and when she was around he was closed off. 

Fast forward and we all 6 plan a trip together. This is when things started to really bother me. We were all throwing ideas out there and the 2nd guy said how his girlfriend was good at finding places to stay so we should let her do it all. 1, I found that a little odd because I figured if we were paying for a trip we should be able to see what we were spending our money on. She recommended we stay at this hotel, but I said an airbnb would be more ideal since we wanted to be near the beach. They all agreed but I could tell she was pissed that they didn’t want what she wanted. Keep in mind we barely know this chick and she just comes in being a control freak. So we go on this trip and let me just say it was a NIGHTMARE. We all put in money for a vehicle and my boyfriend paid extra along with the 2nd guy so he could drive it also. Once we got there, we were never aloud to take the car if we wanted to run for coffee or anything. Every time we asked he said he needed to run it by her and then they’d never mention it again. Keep in mind we’re all in the same house so I didn’t wanna make her upset by saying something. Things like that happened the entire time...her way or the highway. 

When we got home I was very upset because I feel like I paid for a vacation I didn’t enjoy because it was revolved around her wants. It was very awkward and tension was clearly there when we were on the trip, and I didn’t understand why she acted that way towards my boyfriend and I because she was very friendly toward the other couple with us.

So ever since this trip, they’ve done things as a group of 4 and quit inviting us. The guys hang out often, but when she comes around it’s like she doesn’t want my boyfriend and I to be there. They do invite us sometimes but it’s a little uncomfortable because she acts so snooty. Her boyfriend is a nice guy and always has been. My boyfriend started noticing the way things were and asked them why it felt so uncomfortable and they acted like it wasn’t a big deal. I am always nice and respectful to this girl. I am shy, but I don’t act uninterested while we hang out. I don’t want to say something or have my boyfriend because I almost feel like she’s made it out to be that we’re the problem when I truly can’t pinpoint a time we could’ve upset her. What pushed me to write this was my boyfriends friend made a joke that he doesn’t get ass from me (literally out of left field) while they were FaceTiming, just because my boyfriend joked with him about something that he took wrong. I was sitting right there so it instantly pissed me off. I’m assuming he joked that because the guys always talk about how they just got ass or head from their girlfriends and my boyfriend is more respectful than that and doesn’t feel like he needs to just share when we have sex with them. My boyfriend is telling me that he was kidding but I’m fuming.

I don’t want to be that girlfriend who doesn’t like my boyfriends friends or girlfriends. But, I also am not gonna put up with people who treat me bad when I’m around. And now that the guys are saying rude things, it leads me to believe that she talks about us to them because this all began when she came around.

Any advice would be great!",relationship_advice

I'm a 17 year old female who've never been in a relationship. Being so young, that shouldn't be one of my priorities but I just feel so left out from my peers. Most of my high school peers are in relationships looking all cute, while it looks like I'm going to be a crazy, cat lady in the future.

I often think is it my physical appearance that's stopping me from getting a boyfriend? Cause in my opinion (and others), I'm a very kind, understanding, patient, loving person. I often get called adorable from people, I guess due to my child-like aura. But, I can admit I can act dumb, be too sensitive, be insecure and I do suffer from low self esteem. But nobody besides my family really know the negatives about me. So that's why I wonder am I that atrocious that no boy wants to get to know me?

I get called ""pretty"" by others. It used to be mainly by family members and friends so I didn't really believe it. But then more outsiders started complimenting me and I guessed it rose my esteem but not much. And the reason why is that if I'm so ""pretty"" why have I never been in a relationship?

Anyway , around 7 years ago when we were 18 we went to some cabins in the woods to chill with a group of friends, we shared a room between 4 people, 2 guys and 2 girls.

There was only one shower so we took turns. The second day she was the last one to shower and I was in the room and she came in to the room only in her towel and with only me there. There has always been a lot of trust between us so she was very chill drying her hair and we were just talking. Me being a horny 18 year old I wanted more and playfullly hugged her and eventually removed her towel and she was cool about it laguhing and just put it back on. 

Not sure how but eventually we ended in the bed with her towel off and I don't remember the exact details but I think I had to force myself into her. I only remember er saying something like hey what are you doing? Someone will walk in. And I remember we having sex with me on top holding her hands and her just quiet. We didn't talk for the rest of the trip and I remember her crying at some point. 

We stopped talking at all and I thought her boyfriend had found out or something, but I think it was more that the sex we had was not fully consensual and she was scared of me or something.

210,e6nnqg,hooray223,1575580088.0,0,Why has she completely cut me out of her life?,"I’m just kinda confused by it all. It doesn’t make any sense at all. 

I was great to her. I was really great to her. She even said I was a good dude. She said I made her happy. She said she was ‘obviously interested’ as we messaged every day, she said she’d never been this sexually attracted to someone, Etc. 

But she was moving away and she didn’t know what she wanted. She was back and fourth, push pull, and she was so confusing. We had been talking for months so these mixed signals were even more confusing than they should be. 

Eventually I had to go back to university and honestly, I didn’t trust her. She had said some really odd stuff, there were std issues (long story), but we had been so intimate so I thought it might be okay to ask. So I asked her if we could be sexually exclusive. She didn’t have to be my gf because I knew she was unsure about the future but I just needed to know we were at least sexually exclusive. I told her I had an issue from my ex gf when she slept with another man and I just couldn’t continue without knowing that. She refused. Which really hurt and confused me based on how intimate she had been. 

We ‘discussed’ it for a while but she just wouldn’t budge and I eventually caved and said okay I’d keep trying. 

The next day she invited me round for food and at this point I realised I just couldn’t do it and I had to tell her. I told her and she got angry I brought it up again, insisted I was trying to make her my gf and wouldn’t listen to anything I had to say she just got so defensive. We seemingly ended things. 

I send her a message when I get back to uni saying I hope we hadn’t left things on a bad note. Suddenly she gets more interested and starts asking how my day went and stuff. I get more and more confused and eventually I say I don’t think we can talk anymore as it’s too hard for me. She gets angry. Says she doesn’t get it. I try to discuss it some more then she asks for space which upset me but I said okay. 

Over this  ‘space’ she likes all my social media posts and starts interacting with me on fb, tagging me in memes and stuff. Stuff she’d never done before. 

We already had another date planned so after 4 days of not talking I ask her if she’s around when I’m back the next week. She says she’s not doing anything social over exams (which I know is a lie). I’m not trying to stress her out or hurt her. I’m a kind person I just wanted to know where I stood. So I say ‘this isn’t going to change is it’.

Now she gets so so angry. Calls me obsessed, controlling, anger inducing. I get really upset it’s so hurtful. Especially since I’d really fallen for her. I get a bit questioning and asking why she’s so angry that I like her and  she then goes ‘I DONT WANT A BF’ and ‘I NEVER WANTED IT TO WORK OUT YOURE OBSESSED’, which is not what she’d said before. So this obviously really upsets me and I say she won’t hear from me again. 

A week later I apologise and say I hope her exams went well. No reply. A week later I ask how she’s getting on. No reply. Then a week after that we’re at the same event and I ask if she enjoyed it. No reply. 

I don’t hear anything for 3 months. Nothing. I’m pretty severely upset and depressed over this period. I just couldn’t figure out what I did wrong or did to deserve that aggressiveness. So I message her and just congratulate her on graduating (saw it on fb). She replies saying she was sorry she didn’t reply it just got too intense and then wished me luck for the future. I told her not to worry and things were good with me, and said good luck to her too. I start thinking it’s truly over. 

Then a week later during  my graduation ball she reads me on social media. Out of the blue. She would’ve had to look me up and actively find me. So at this point I’m so done with all the mind games and mental pain this has caused me so I message her asking why she did it and tell her Its just more mixed signals. She said she wanted to be friends.... 

After 3 months of ignoring me and calling me obsessed?! What?! So I reply ‘I’m sorry I don’t think we can be. If you want to date me date me but if you don’t then I can’t be just friends I’m sorry’. 

Now she goes off and says I’m immature for the way I read our situation (still don’t know what that was) and it’s exactly why she didn’t want more with me. Then some more hurtful things, telling me off for ‘acting too much like a bf’?! And ‘asking her on dates too often’?! (I asked her like twice a week. And she also says she’s ‘confused why she didn’t follow me on social media anymore’. Really? You’re really confused?!   

Now she’s told me to go no contact as she’s ‘so done with me’. 

It took some time for me to cool off and remove the emotion. When I did I messaged her saying if she wants to be friends that’s okay. I apologise for getting over run with emotion but I was going through a really hard time and explain how things are better now. No response. 

I’m just confused why she wouldn’t even respond to that. I’ll be honest, I loved this girl, and she was just so hurtful. But I never did anything wrong to her. Maybe I did act too much like a bf, but what’s wrong with that when she never told me I couldn’t. All the mixed signals were confusing as hell and she had messaged me for months so I just figured she was guarding herself, so I just tried to show her how great it could be with me. Especially when we seemed to both feel a connection. 

Just confused why she’s completely cut me out of her life? Any ideas? Please go easy haha

214,e6nkaw,cadenmacmichel,1575579717.0,1,I [27M] am trying to figure out if/how to break up with my partner [30M],"We are not committed, monogamous boyfriends, but I have been seeing him for upwards of 4 years now. Birthday dates, occasional outings, late-night hangouts... I’ve even watched his house and cat for multiple weeks when he needed to leave town on business trips. We’ve made declarations of love, and it’s a comfortable, if informal, relationship.

The cons are that we don’t have a lot in common, and he’s not the best communicator. I never seem able to get his wants/goals for himself or or relationship out of him. To complicate matters, he started seeing someone [23M] about a year ago, an official Boyfriend. The boyfriend is a sweetie, so that’s not an issue. He talked to me about it first, and everything was discussed. But I started seeing another person [38M] and he’s... not as immediately physically attractive as Partner 1, but we have so much more in common. Similarly, Partner 1 and his boyfriend seem to have more in common than he and I do. Not to be crass, but it seems like sex has been the driving force of our relationship for over a year. My interests are almost exclusively “Tabletop Nerd” (historic reenactment societies, D&D, board game expos) and he’s... a Party Gay. Which isn’t bad, it just means that we generally have more fun when we aren’t together.

TL;DR My longterm non-monogamous partner and I have been growing apart over the past year, while we’ve both become more close and connected to other partners. I’m trying to figure out if/how to end it.",relationship_advice

Me (20M) and my (20F) girlfriend of 2 years broke up on Sunday. We have a very interconnected friendship group. Every time her name appears in a group chat comment or I see something on social media that I would have sent to her it hurts. 

I just need to know how to get out of the pain of not being with her anymore. It was me and that ended it and I know (logically) that it was the right thing to do for the both of us but I just see her and regret we aren’t back a couple of months ago when we were amazing.

216,e6ngbf,hajarelkacemy,1575579283.0,0,I'm really in love with him but maybe I have no future with him,"I publish this post to vent and to look for further points of view. 

I, of Muslim religion (20 / F), am in a quite serious relationship with my boyfriend, atheist (21 / M).  With committed I mean that despite being together with him for almost six months I already foresee our children, and the same goes for him.

A few months ago my mom found out about my relationship and tried to make me break up. I reacted by trying to run away from home in the middle of the night with the guarantee that he would come and get me.  Mom found me, while he didn't come because ""my grandmother was too worried about me leaving so late at night"", his parents knew the whole situation and were ready to sau welcome to me.  Mom, seeing what I came to do for him, gave him an opportunity as long as he converts if he wants to marry me.  She considers him a caring and kind boy, and indeed he is.  I cannot reproach him with anything from this point of view: he treats me like a princess.  We have accepted the compromise obviously thinking of its fake conversion.
This is the frame.

Yesterday, after spending a wonderful day together, he brought up the conversation.  I came to complain that despite him allowing me to raise my hypothetical children as Muslims, they would see their father having totally different behaviors and could grow up with psychological complexes: not understanding why mom says to do difficult things while dad breaks the rules.  I told him that the issue has been bothering me for months because in the end, the lies I would tell my parents, would come up.  He replied that break up is not an option and that I should therefore leave my family because they are the ones who do not accept our relationship.
I started crying.  I wept for two solid hours, knowing that one day I would have to choose between the two entities I love most.  I didn't stop even when he brought me home, while he kept explaining to me that it's a situation to be solved in this way and that he, in turn, would have denied his family if he had been in such a matter.  I went to sleep always having the same nightmare, all night: I left my family, I got married to my current boyfriend and after a few years I discovered that he cheated on me several times, doing to return to their family they rightly denied me in turn.

Today I went to sleep with him in the morning because I didn't have the strength to stay at home to face my mom with yet another fake smile or to study at university.  We stayed in bed with our arms around each other, finally I fell asleep and had the same nightmare I told him about.  I woke up and was happy to be in his arms, I told him that I had the same dream yesterday and I asked him for reassurance ""You promise you won't leave me alone?"", He replied with all the naturalness ""  I'm sorry but I can't swear to these things, it's like swearing not to do car accidents. ""  At that point I was even worse than before.  In a certain sense he was right but I believe that in such a situation he should have bent his response to my momentary sensitivity.  I started crying louder than before.  He was close to me in order to console me, to tell me that I am strong and that I will make the right choice being with him.

Now I am at home thinking about all this: it is clear that with him there is no future.  I could turn my back on my family and in the future hear me say ""But I told you I couldn't swear.""  I reflect and think about the fact that it is not just a matter of the sentence itself, it is the mentality behind it. He can apologize, I forgive him but then?  What guarantees do I have? My best friend, atheist as well, agrees with my vision.  For the talk about children too.


A few hours ago I texted him saying that I need a break until Sunday and that we would see each other directly on Monday.  I would like to reflect and discuss how I felt and, if I saw that there is actually no future with him, to give up.
And now you come into play, I would like those who came to read up to here to help me make my decision.  I need more points of view.  Thank you all for any support.


 P. S. His family situation is rather fragmented.  His parents divorced, while my parents deeply love each other.  So he has a different view of the family but he aspires to have a healthy one with me.",relationship_advice

218,e6nd3m,Mother_Deer,1575578939.0,1,Should I (26M) approach my ex (24F) after she broke up with me last July?,"Here is some background. Me and Jane were together for almost two years this summer when a secret I've been keeping came to surface and she broke up with me. 
During the begging of our relationship I had to move town for a few months to work at a beach bar for the summer. At the place where I was working there was this foreign girl that I knew would be visiting and I had mentioned her existence to Jane as a pretty cool girl that I knew. This made her quite uncomfortable and she specifically asked me not to have any contact with her. A request which I broke. I didn't hook up with her but I actively pursued meeting her and hanging out with her due to the fact that I was honestly enjoying her company. I then lied to Jane and told her that I had zero contact with her a lie which she easily saw through and didn't stop asking details about that summer even after two beautiful years in our relationship. I never actually admitted to the fact that I was hanging out with the girl she was so adamant I shouldn't be hanging out with and this past July her demons got the better of her and she snooped around my Facebook messenger one morning while I was at work. This made her realize that I at least was frequently meeting that other girl and she broke down and asked me to split.
I love Jane. I never stopped loving her and these past five months have been a living nightmare since I just keep her out of my mind. We met once back in September and she told me that while she can forgive me for what I did, trusting me is a different thing since it would require a lot of effort on her behalf and she would prefer to target this effort towards herself. She mentioned that the last few months of our relationship she had found herself caring a lot more about people around her, specifically me and a few of her girlfriends, instead of caring about personal issues and she would like to focus on her for the time being. 
I visited a psychologist soon after our break-up since I honestly couldn't handle it at all and I'm making changes in my life that should have made me feel better about the whole situation but here I am typing this wall of text for the kind hearted person that would take the time to listen to my tale... 
Should I contact her and ask her out for a drink? I can't bear the thought of staying away from this girl for a minute longer but I'm doing it since this is what she said it would be better for her. 

Please excuse my terrible formatting since I'm on mobile and English is not my mother tongue. For any additional information don't hesitate to ask! 

tl;dr girl broke up with me for lying to her two years ago and now my heart is hurting so bad that I am moments away from asking her to meet me again for second try.

Now, understandably this has caused her to have some hang-ups around sex: she says that whenever we have sex she enjoys it in the moment but afterwards she feels like she’s done something horrible and wrong and she feels sick to her stomach. Sometimes even just kissing triggers it. Hearing all this has been really upsetting because I obviously don’t want her to feel this way, but I don’t know how to help. I would never pressure her into doing anything she doesn’t want to do and every time we’ve had sex she has seemed willing, but now that I know about her past I’m afraid to even try to initiate sex. We still cuddle and I’ve been asking her if it’s OK for me to touch her under her shirt etc but I always stop myself from going further than that. She’s also very shy about touching me and never really initiates sex unless she’s drunk.

We moved in together just over a year ago. He is self employed and works from home.  I work from home as well but under someone as manager. Solo work but 45 hours a week.

3 months after moving in together my boyfriend wanted to try to change career paths and start another business. He tried finding someone to help him with his current business cause he couldnt survive with out it but the business wouldnt make enough to pay a worker and support him while trying something new. So I in and took over his business and ran it for free. Meanwhile he left and moved states for 7 months to start something new while I stayed home and ran things and made sure he had money in his pocket. 

My mom came and helped me for free when I needed it and especially when I found out my dog who I was super attached too had terminal cancer and was expected to die in 2 months. I was devastated. I was swamped with his work and mine while watching my dog slowly die. He called me one day and said his mom, step dad, sister wanted to plan a trip to Aruba for christmas  and they were paying for him and he wanted to split a ticket share and hotel prices with me so i could go to. Later the trip was cancelled and then his family was coming into town and having christmas at our home instead.

3 days before my boyfriend makes it home my dog died. This was october 31.

Day after thanksgiving his mom calls him and says they planned a surprise trip for there family to go to the Bahamas. I'm not invited because they want it to be just the family. And his sister is going off to college. So then they just expect me to watch my boyfriends dog and take care of his business again on Christmas alone because I'm not part of the family. This is literally tearing my relationship apart right now cause I can't get over it. He even mentioned to me like saying well we havent been together long and it's not like we are married. And me bringing up anything about how I helped him is called manipulation. Now he has his mom involved and we are all angry at eachother.

225,e6n7c3,ThrowRA-ad,1575578283.0,3,I (23F) feel my parents (52F) (M40) take advantage of me,"A note: ""Dad"" written in this post is actually my step-father, as I have not seen my real dad in 6 years.

Hey everyone, I've been constantly at my limit for some time and at a loss for what to do. Here's some beginning context; I've been living with my mom and her husband since I was 17, and at the time she was pregnant. My step brother(6M) (I have another brother (20M) who also lives with us, he and I have the same birth father) was born when I was about 17.5. Since his birth, my parents have basically made me his personal nanny/mother as I could count the number of times they've changed his diapers. I have no ill-will towards the little guy, I love him dearly and he respects and trusts me more than he does them. I find that to be a bit sad though.

Where the problem really is is that my parents expect me to take care of everything. My mom is the breadwinner and my dad picks up the odd labor type job (he's a contractor) every so often so money gets tight when he's not working. I respect that, and I try my best to help out where I can, but it gets a bit exhaustive when I'm expected to cook, clean, child-mind and I'm a student in university taking 5 courses a semester so I can get my degree faster. I wouldn't have a problem doing all that, except its expected every day of me AND no one ever bothers to lift a finger to help. Dad's even gone out of his way to say ""I'm not doing shit"" in respects to me asking people to help me with housekeeping and cooking. On top of that, any time I slip up and forget to do something, or don't do something to their standards I'm called names. Such names include; ""Useless, retard, stupid, etc.""

They also stalk me on my social media and any time I post anything (I'm an art student and post my artwork) I get chastising texts from dad saying ""Oh you have enough time to do XYZ but not Clean/Cook/Do your homework only?""  


The constant berating from them on top of the daily routine being more than I can handle is exhausting. (Basically between the hours of 2:30pm - 10:30pm I have no time to myself because I'm watching my little brother, helping him study, cooking dinner, and cleaning dishes/the kitchen). On weekends its worse because they always drag me out for their shopping and if I say no I get an attitude from them saying ""Well you have to clean and that's it, I have my phone on me and will be checking.""

I've tried asking the older of my two brothers to help me but he also refuses to help and yells at me and has even hit me before (He has High functioning autism and Aspergers so I don't excuse the behaviour but I try to do my best to not set him off).

I just am looking for advice on what I can do to either A) Improve relationship with my parents or B) Things I can do to not let things get to me.  


I've tried talking to them and it never works, I get yelled at and called names or unappreciative, spoiled, selfish, etc. Especially dad, I can't ever talk to him as if he hears something he doesn't want to he goes on a tyraid and calls me a ""Fucking Bastard"" or something similar. He also likes to bring up the fact that my birth dad abandoned me a lot too. It's not financially feasible for me to move out as I live in in an area where rental prices are around 2400$CAD for a studio apartment. I am also about 7000$ USD in debt because in order for my parents to not be evicted from our old home (my mom was missing mortgage payments, we were trying to sell to leave the country) I had to take out a loan from my old school and I want them to pay it back.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

My parents leave my step brother (6M) in my care every day while also expecting me to be a house wife while I'm a student in university just trying to get a degree. If I speak up I'm called awful things. Its not easy for me to leave because I'm in debt thanks to them and I had to take out a loan for them to pay their mortgage

226,e6n6nt,nuclearmed18,1575578209.0,2,My girlfriends parents are driving me to a breaking point.,"My girlfriend and I started dating almost 2 years ago. We have an AMAZINGLY healthy and beautiful relationship. We are both in college, work part-time, and live off campus....with her parents. In the beginning of the relationship, it was great. We didn’t live together or anything at that point and went to different schools. Then she transferred and switched her major and we went to the same University. This is when the issues started. 

I started staying over a bit more often and her parents didn’t mind. They actually invited me to move in so I didn’t waste money as I’m in a bunch of student debt (who isn’t though...). So I eventually sat down with my girlfriend and her parents and we sorted through everything and I decided to permanently move in after a year of us together. We still are happy living together because my home is super toxic and I specifically worked at college over the summer to avoid going home, therefore we agreed on still taking time with things and not rushing our relationship along just because we lived together. 

Overtime, the true colors of her parents started to show. My girlfriend would tell me how they were, things they would say to her, and I believed it but had never experienced it so I had just come to the conclusion that maybe they had changed. Personal growth can happen all the time! But, then shit was hitting the fan and all the time I would just hear then insult her intelligence and basically tell her to stop going to school and just get another local job because she doesn’t have the capability to learn. It has gotten so much worse to the fact that her mom continues to go to her doctor appointments and says “I still go because she doesn’t understand what they are saying” and “well I need to fill out her paperwork for her” and it’s like....she’s in her mid 20’s!!! She knows and is planning on applying to occupational therapy school! My girlfriend is so freaking smart!! 

But here I am, shutting my mouth because...I’m living in their house. I don’t want to overstep my boundaries and open my mouth or piss someone off. We can’t keep any of our stuff downstairs (which is typically a jacket or a lunchbox) or we get yelled at. If we talk a bit loud, they jack up the TV and make comments under their breath about us being downstairs EATING DINNER at the table!!! This is just a scratch in the surface of what we go through. And to some people this may seem like nothing, but behind your significant other’s back, hearing her parents bash her day in and day out is so draining. I can’t react, I can’t say anything. I’m at a loss as to what to do. 

But now, it seems like they are now coming at my education and questioning my intelligence which is pissing me off. I study Nuclear Medicine Technology and want to eventually study Anatomy and Cardiac Perfusion and teach one day. The other day I had an interview to teach an EKG course. Her dad said to me “do you even know how to teach? Do you know the material? How are you going to make lesson plans if you’ve never done it before?” 

This is just one thing. We can’t move out until we graduate (about 2 years) due to some financial issues, but I don’t know if I can continue to do this anymore!! Every single day for over a year this is been going on. I literally am going to lose my mind. I went to counseling for a while because they are making me lose my mind. They are also both retired too so they are always home. 

If anyone has ANY suggestions to help me, I can’t even tell you how much I would appreciate it. Luckily the issues with her parents haven’t come between us that much. We have gotten into a few disagreements, but we always figure it out and I’d say more or less, it has brought us closer. We have a strong relationship.

My roommate is cool and totally fine for the most part, however she recently told me she stopped taking her medication for 3 weeks. She isn't like totally off the wall but I can see she is a little bit different in her mood and how she is kind of acting.

edit: She has bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety. 

I told her would buy her alcohol (yes I know this is already a stupid decision but don't act like it is unusual) for her bc I know she is usually responsible, but now that I see she is kind of unstable and not doing well, I honestly probably won't get it for her bc I don't want to be responsible for something she could do.

What do I do?

I just need advice on how to handle this, because I am definitely not getting it for her now because she even admitted to me that she has been making poor life choices lately and I am not about to be the cause of her getting herself killed or doing something stupid.

I also understand that giving alcohol to people underage is stupid, I don't usually give it to people unless they are in my house with me and I am with them, so I can make sure they aren't being stupid. This situation, I couldn't be sure that she wouldn't do something dumb.

She is going to her psychiatrist today so hopefully that gets her under control, but for now I am going to just avoid the conversation about alcohol with her.

229,e6n491,anonymousfridge,1575577939.0,0,A girl (16f) who I'm (16m) seeing found about about my friend (16f).,"This is a bit of a story, so just bear with me.

There's this girl (we can call her Brooke) who's a grade below me who I've gone on three or four dates with so far. We haven't declared ourselves as a couple yet or set any boundaries. We haven't even kissed yet. I've kind of known her for a few years, but we only really started talking within the past few months. There have been a few bumps in our (growing) relationship so far. One of my best friends, Ben, dated her about six months, and he already wasn't very thrilled about us going out, but I assessed whether or not it'd ruin our friendship and realized he'd probably get over it.

I would never do anything to ruin that friendship with Ben. If I keep going out with Brooke (even after this fuck up) and it ruins my friendship with Ben, I'll end the relationship.

Anyway, Brooke also has had some issues with serious depression in the past. She has cut. She has even attempted suicide once or twice. But she's getting better now, I'm pretty sure. I've been very careful to always be kind around her, and if I do need to leave her because of Ben, I'm going to try to do it in the nicest way possible. She's a great person: she has lots of friends, no enemies, and is kind to everyone. She said she'd even still be my friend if she doesn't want to date me after what I've done.

Here's how I fucked up. So, I have this very good friend, she's 16, let's call her Ariel. Nothing has ever happened between me and Ariel. She and I have been friends for like 12 years, and it's always been platonic. But, it's that friendship where nothing has ever happened because it's never been the right time or the right place. Ariel and I have always been close, and she'll stay over at my house and sleep on the same couch as me.

Nothing was different this time, she was staying overnight over Thanksgiving. We fell asleep on the couch together cuddling (platonically). Then, we wake up. It's the morning horny/deliriousness if any of you know what I'm talking about. After a lot of super slow, subtle hand movements, one thing lead to another, and I was touching her breasts. Bare. It was only for a minute or two (since I didn't feel super comfortable about it), and then I moved my hand.

But then, a few minutes later, I was groping her lower parts over her pants, and she was doing the same to me. It went on for like 30 seconds to a minute until I said ""this is wrong."" I stopped things. Ariel knows what I have going on with Brooke, but since Brooke and I never made anything official or set any rules, we both figured it wasn't technically cheating. Even so, with Brooke in my mind, I stopped what Ariel and I were doing. After that, we lied there for about 10 minutes until she had to leave.

Later that day, Ariel and I texted each other exchanging apologies and promised to never speak about this again.

Long story short, Ariel broke that promise. She told Amanda, a close friend of me, Ariel, and also *Brooke*. Now Amanda can't keep her mouth shut. She texted me yesterday that we need to talk about Ariel and Brooke, and I found out that Amanda told Brooke about what happened between me and Ariel. Not a very good situation.

Ariel conveniently forgot to tell Amanda that I stopped things, so Brooke didn't know that when I talked to her.

So I facetimed Brooke about 30 minutes after I talked to Amanda to figure out everything that was said. Well, Brooke was super upset and had already told her friends (some of whom are also my friends), so now a lot of them think I'm the biggest asshole. 

I told Brooke that I had really fucked up. I told her we didn't have any rules set, and I still didn't know what I was gonna do about us because of Ben. I was waiting to get back from Thanksgiving Break to see if Ben and I were still friends. We are. I told Brooke I didn't initiate anything, it just happened. I told Brooke I didn't even kiss Ariel (which I didn't). *I told Brooke I stopped things.* I told Brooke it was early and I wasn't thinking straight.

I had to have apologized a million times. She's cancelled our next date tomorrow, and now she's reconsidering going out with me anymore. She's been cheated on before, and she doesn't want it to happen again. She doesn't know me well enough yet to know that I'm a loyal person; I was in a relationship for almost two years and never even thought about anyone else. I wish this whole situation never happened, and now I don't know how to get out.

I missed school today because I'm so distraught. I don't know how to get Brooke back. I don't know whether or not to be mad at Ariel or at Amanda, and I don't know if it's for the better if she leaves me so I don't have to deal with issues with Ben.

What do I do?

TLDR; A girl who I really like and have been on a few dates with (who's also one of my best friends' ex girlfriends) found out about another girl who I'm friends with who I felt up and who felt up me.",relationship_advice

Now the main issue was that I and her were both in long relationships. Recently I discovered my SO was cheating so I cut her off and her SO was treating her like shit or something of the likes so they are no longer together all happening within this month. That being said I asked her to let me take her out to dinner this weekend and she replied saying if she isn’t busy then sure. Happy as I was that wasn’t good enough so the next day I texted her and asked her to make sure she had room for me and not to make plans and yet again she obliged. Now here comes my issue. Everything worked out so perfectly that i don’t know how to feel about it and I’m not sure what to do I did not specify it as a date or anything and were only going to get fast food of her choosing so I’m not sure how to tell if she’s into me or just wants to get some food. I plan on confessing that I have feelings for her while we are out and I’m not sure how to do that properly without looking dumb. I could always wait it out and tell her another time but I tend to be upfront and honest when it comes to my feelings in relationships but I really don’t want to mess this up...,relationship_advice
231,e6n3hq,Ewthrowitfaraway,1575577855.0,1,My [22M] boyfriend just broke it off after I [21] F cancelled our plans because I wanted to stay at home with my lonely dad.,"I can't even believe I am writing this honestly. Okay so, we have been together for a couple months now but we did date in the past as teens. He is the type of person to tell you what you want to hear but he probably feels the exact opposite. We live in Colorado about 30 min away from each other. It's so hard to see each other during the week because we work opposite schedules and with traffic in the AM/PM after work, getting to his place takes over an hour. So, we planned for myself to come over last night and stay the night and head to work the next morning, mainly because I left my makeup at his house and I needed that too. Cool. Well I get home from the gym last night getting ready to leave, and my dad is upset about having to be by himself and he has just had a hard day, topping it off with his wife not being home because she is out of town. So I offer to stay, and my dad said that would be great, he just really didn't want to be by himself for some reason. We played Super Smash and smoked a lot and I could tell his spirits were up. (No my dad has never done this and he does not do this EVER he actually really likes my BF) So my BF says that's totally fine. ""Stay in, it's late anyway"" I offer to smoke him out on some bud and give him gas money if he wants to come to my place and he declines and his mood just switches. He becomes very hostile and short with me over text. When I said earlier that he will tell you what you want to hear and not how he's feeling, this is incredibly true. I have brought this up to him before and he said he would work on it for the sake of our relationship because I am a confrontational person and he is not. I tell him I love him and all I get is a ""you too"" back. This set me the fuck off because with the amount of people I have lost, I do not ever leave a conversation or withhold an ""I love you too"" just because I am angry. I would hate myself if my last words to someones I love you were a ""you too"" So we don't talk for the rest of the night. This morning I get a ""Morning"" from him. I don't respond because I am not here to brush shit under the rug like it didn't happen, once again he has told me what I want to hear and not how he is feeling when it came to me cancelling plans. He proceeds to subtweet me over twitter like he ALWAYS DOES. Finally he reaches out to me and says that he feels I don't know myself well enough and he doesn't think I am ready for a relationship because he feels like all he does is ""chase."" whatever that fuck that means. I have held this man in my arms while he has bawled his eyes out, I have been there for him when his friends weren't. I am just confused as to how you ""chase"" someone who has been by your side the whole time.  I wish I was making this shit up. I tell him I know exactly what I want, and a passive aggressive man who can't ever tell his girlfriend how he is feeling is not what I want. He ends it with saying ""well i guess that settles it"" and now I am here, not even sad but just confused. I guess I pictured an entirely different conversation when I cancelled plans. I expected him to be upset, but I figured maybe he would tell me he was and not lie and say he's fine. He has his shit together in every other way. Financials are awesome, responsibility, drive, acceptance of my bisexuality. It's all there. But he cannot open up, ever. I was fully ready to take the blame and reassure him that we can re-schedule for another night and that I understand why he is so upset, but this I just cannot wrap my head around. I told him I was done being the one to pry things out of him when I see a subtweet or a deleted picture of myself on his socials. It is so childish. I just don't even know where to go from here guys, I am so confused. Someone put me in my place for being an asshole or tell me how to proceed with moving on/helping him open up.",relationship_advice
232,e6n38d,throwawayacc09090909,1575577819.0,1,"I (21,F) hooked up with my best friend (M,24) and now we don’t speak to each other","Hello all. I aplogize for the long text, but it’s a complicated story. So as the title says it, me and my good friend hookep up for the last two months. It all started when we were hanging out and got drunk together. Now, until then, I honestly didn’t see him as anything else other than a friend (we’ve known each other for 7+ years). I knew he used to have a huge crush on me, as he confessed before, but I didn’t return his feelings and we remained friends.

After the first time it happened, neither of us brought it up. I assumed it was just one drunken mistake, but I was starting to worry a bit if it’s going to affect us in the future. We got even closer and started hanging out and talking more, and of course, ended up hooking up on the regular. We still didn’t properly talk about what was going on. I honestly avoided bringing it up because I was confused with my feelings about him/this, I was never attracted to a friend before and didn’t know how to handle the situation (kinda cowardly, I know). I was also worried about the possibility of destroying the friendship. I found out that a mutual friend asked him if we’re together now and he told him that basically we are, but we didn’t talk about it yet. 

Recently I noticed he started to become a bit distant, and last time we met he acted like I didn’t exist, which was unusual. That night we were out with friends and we both got a bt drunk and well, hell broke loose.
He seemed angry at me and asked me if I wanted a relationship with him. I told him I wasn’t sure about what I wanted (which is true) but that I enjoyed what we were doing so far (again true). He then said that he can’t have a relationship right now, because it would distract him from school (he has quite a few important exams + he’s in his final year) and that what we were doing was already starting to distract him and he doesn’t want to fail. I should also mention that he’s had depressive episodes before.
Since I was a bit drunk I got reactive and told him that it wasn’t a reason for him to distance himself and ignore me all of a sudden, that he should’ve told me what was going on. I also told him that I heard the whole ‘don’t want a relationship right now’ excuse before and that he can tell me the actual truth. He told me that it is the truth. I asked what are we doing now. And he said that it’s better if we stop hooking up.
After we got home I send him a message saying that I didn’t want to lose him as a friend but he didn’t respond. We haven’t talked since and honestly I just want things to go back to how they were before, and I don’t know what’s to do now. I feel like he doesn’t even care about what happened.",relationship_advice
233,e6n2r1,tossmeout7778,1575577763.0,8,I fucked my husband's brother,"TLDR - had sex with husband's brother. 19 years ago!!!!!!!! Husband still occasionally brings this up (not in a joking manner) I'm over it. 

I hate writing out ""stories"" so I'll give some facts...

- this happened 19 years ago!!! 19 years for fucks sake! Before I even knew my husband 

- I have avoided most (as much as possible) contact with my BIL since, as I know it makes hubby uncomfortable if we're around each other. That's fine I have no problem avoiding BIL

- we never had a relationship, all we did was hate fuck. 

- my marriage is great, I feel, but every now and then my husband will get little digs in out of nowhere. Example: hubby recently got a jew job traveling, he says before he leaves ""glad my brother isnt around anymore"" implying that I would fuck him again, I guess???  (BIL moved a few years ago, he's not dead)
OR.... there have been instances where hubby will go down the ""is he bigger than me"" ""fuck you better than me"" road. 

You guys, I just cannot with this shit anymore, it's exhausting. Please help me help him get over this.

Edit for more backstory to hopefully get the best advice possible :

- Hubby has known about this the entirety of our relationship, I never addressed it, my BIL told him a few weeks after we (hubby & I) started dating) I have no idea what was said in that convo and now that I'm really thinking about this... once, about 7 years ago. BIL threw this in my hubby's face (that was a fun day 😩) THIS RIGHT HERE is when the comments became more frequent. 

- their sibling dynamic is often times, volatile.

- hubby is a great partner, fantastic father, and he's just a good person. BIL is waste of oxygen.",relationship_advice

that week i kept on contacting him to talk things out because i truly love and care about him even though he has been hurting me so much the last couple of months of our relationship. but when i did he told me many awful things like “I’ll love someone else more than i loved you & i will marry someone else” knowing all i wanted was to marry him one day. 

after that I didn’t say a word, he tried reaching out and stuff but i didn’t listen because he was STILL saying those awful things whilst trying to fix it, ikr big ego. And it probably hurt his ego so when i tried reaching out the last time he told me we are done for good. Ever since i did not contact him. 

See i have a following online and i never talked about him after the breakup. Its just sometimes i said i was upset when i was being asked but never mentioned him NEVER. 

People were literally noticing how off iv been. Anyways, i woke up to his stories responding to a question 2 days ago calling me all sorts of names whilst telling people to “be kind to each other” I literally started bawling my eyes out. He was calling me out for “faking it” & acting like as if i was a “victim” like what the hell,isn’t it normal to feel upset after a break up??? It was just way too aggressive and not to mention he asked the question to himself because those times when he contacted me he kept on asking me “why do u act like i abused you” and he asked the same question like “why did u abuse ur girlfriend” like literally the same manner and words. 

I just don’t get it, even today he posted something that wasn’t even about me yet he was being shady again. I don’t get it. Can someone tell me what’s going on??? I’m so confused. Why is he being like that? I didn’t break up with him like wtf please help",relationship_advice

239,e6myq9,moe_sizlak,1575577305.0,1,"My (m29) uncle (m55) has decide to cut ties with me and my family, starting by shouting at my mum (f62) in the Street.","Probably quite a long post as there’s a lot of backstory here! So apologies for that! 

To try to cut a long story as short as possible, my dad died when I was 11, he had two younger brothers. The middle brother is basically estranged from the majority of our family due to abusive behaviour and most likely being an alcoholic. However, we have always had a close relationship with youngest brother of the three, as well as his wife and kids. 

Over the last few years there have been some petty arguments between my mum and my auntie/uncle, in my opinion neither side was right in these arguments, and they could have easily been resolved by a simple apology from both sides, or one side swallowing their pride each time, and moving on. 

In any case, although there has been some tension between my mum and my uncle’s family, I was under the impression everything was fairly civil and I personally had no problems with my uncle and his family.

Recently, my brother got married. Prior to the wedding my mum met with my uncle for a coffee to check everything was ok, during their discussions, my uncle brought up the fact that my mum should forgive our estranged uncle for his behaviour in the past. 

*(For an example of his behaviour, about 7/8 years after the death of my dad, he turned up at my mums house drunk, and accused her of being involved in the murder of my dad, for insurance money. To clarify, my dad died by falling off of a cliff on a hike he went on alone while we were on holiday, just a tragic accident, obviously my mum had no involvement in this. In my opinion his behaviour that night, and other matters that aren’t worth going into, are unforgivable, and my brother and I don’t have a relationship with him at all.)*

My uncle got very angry about my mums refusal to forgive his brother, and then after that, I understand they parted ways on fairly good terms, and I believe they agreed to try and see more of each other in the future. 

FYI, my mum told nobody about this conversation, until after the events that happened after the wedding. 

We had my brothers wedding, and everything seemed fine. 

A week after the wedding my mum phoned me, and told me the story of the coffee they had, and then told me that she saw my uncle in town while shopping and went to say hello. He shouted across the street to her **“I’m done with you, never speak to me again!”** also to note, my mum had a stroke in March of this year, which affected her speech so was unable to reply back to him at the time.

I then texted my uncle to meet me for a beer to try and sort this out. He said he needed time to calm down, and that the wedding was the last straw, and that he had issues with his relationship with me, my mum and my brother for a while.

After a couple of weeks he agreed to meet me, and proceeded to tell me that he believes my family had behaved abhorrently toward his family in general, and especially at the wedding. I asked for specifics and he raised the following:

1.	We didn’t speak to him, his wife and his kids enough at the wedding

2.	they didn’t have a seat at the front of the wedding, the main issue being his mum (my grandma) not having a seat at the front. (On this point, they were sat about 4/ 5 rows from the front, and before the ceremony started, we noticed my grandma wasn’t in a good spot, so moved her to the front row where we had a spare spot) there was no seating plan in general. 

3.	his wife and kids weren’t included in the formal photos. (This was due to the fact the my bother didn’t want many photos, and his wife family has a huge amount of uncles/aunties so they had to decide on a small number of photos. I can see how this could be read as offensive and apologised on this point, but it was just an honest decision by my brother to include my uncle and my grandma in a photo, to avoid adding more and more photos to the list.

4.	We didn’t speak to them much at the party my brother had at a pub the day after, and he was annoyed we were playing some drinking games. 

I argued my case on the points above to say that nothing was intentionally meant to be offend or exclude them, but mainly the wedding wasn’t about them, we were busy and also trying to enjoy ourselves. It was a tough day due to us being sad my dad wasn’t there, and also happy my mum had recovered from her stroke, so we were not really taking about others.  

I said I was there to try and resolve the problems between the family, and he went on to say he doesn’t think he will ever forgive us or want to speak to us again. 

During the conversation, he told me that my dad would’ve been on his shoulder when he shouted at my mum in the street, and would’ve also been on his shoulder as we were talking in the pub. I told him it was unfair to put words in my dead dads mouth and decide which side he would be in, and he proceeded to tell me that he knew him better than me, and was not going to take back what he said. 

His main issue seems to be that we did not have a close relationship any more, which we had done back when I was younger. 

I accepted that, but also noted I had moved away from my home town, and that it goes both ways. In the sense that I hadn’t tried to see them much, they hadn’t done the same. He took no responsibility on this point and put all the blame on me and my mum/brother. 

I raised a few things about how I had tried to reach out them, but he just batted it back saying I was lying. I tried to show him the texts proving it and he just wouldn’t accept that I had tried. 

After a few more words, he then stormed out of the pub. 

So, the advice I am after is to find out how to go from here.

I can not see how I can forgive him for what he said about my dad, but I have no issues with his two children that are a few years younger than me. Do I text them to try and have some form of relationship in the future? I was thinking to do this after Christmas to avoid any further problems. Or, do I just give him his wish, and never see them again?

We will have to see them all next year at a relatives wedding that we are all invited to, and will likely be on the same table. I don’t want to tell the bride/groom about this, as it’s unfair to make their wedding planning more complicated than it would be anyway. Or, do I tell them and ask be sat on a different table? I am fully willing to be sat on a table with them, and will be able to be civil and not cause any problems, I cannot say for sure they will feel the same. 

For anyone that gets this far, feel free to ask for more info as this has a lot of backstory that I couldn’t fit in here, and thanks for reading. 

TL:DR - my uncle has decided he wants nothing to do with my family, after what I see as petty problems that could easily be resolved. Do I try to fix this, or just give him his wish and cut ties?",relationship_advice
240,e6mxvg,Suwoth,1575577210.0,1,I (20F) have made a new (21f) friend. I've been a recluse most of my life and im unsure if this is the natural friendship progression.,"I will preface this with saying since I was 18, my father died and left me without enough that I won't ever have to work, The house was sold and I was the only benefactor, This has the added effect of me not leaving the house since then, also not really having friends since I were 13.

So I am having mental health issues, no doctors here really know whats going on so I talked to a specialist in california, I being socially inept sought out help for this. I looked everywhere and finally found a girl in my town, I specifically wanted a girl because in my mind its safer, anyways she was pretty and had a goth vibe so I was in. The reason I want another person with me is because, I am decent looking at when people stare or look at me without reason, my paranoia shoots through the ROOF.

Anyways, we take the plane flight talking the entire way, she is very nice to me and very considerate, and of course being starved of attention its really the only thing I can think about. We have a lot of the same interests and a lot in common in general, she is also gay.. which I already knew (okay I know thats really messed up but hey) so talking was very easy once I opened up.

So we land, she rents us a car and drives me around, and while we were waiting to see the specialist I was obviously quite nervous, and she held my hand which okay, kind of is mind blowing.

Anyways I finally get hope of a diagnosis, we fly back, and we text. a bunch ect, I tell her im almost always home alone 24/7 and that it scares me a lot, and I hate it, so the very next day, I get a knock on my door and it's her with a Pizza, a big duffel bag ect. She tells me not to worry about it and she can hang with me for as long as I want. So for the past three days she's been sleeping here, cooking and all that.. but my paranoid mind .. and this makes me cry, feels like im being taken advantage of, but she didn't know I was ""rich"" and she talks to me every night before I sleep, and makes sure I fall asleep before her.

Is this normal? Is this how friendships are? I also at the same time feel this is the best thing that has ever  happened to me in my entire life.

(this is also an extremely watered down version of the events and im not sure if I should write the entirety of meeting ect because the post gets removed if it's too big..also I must add my age is give or take 1 to 2 years off, i'm paranoid about stating my real age for whatever reason my brain decided, so apologies.)

But he was cool and laid back. Now this blonde lady who i met a couple weeks ago and asked her what her job is, she said she was the business something and her job was to make sure the place saves money while still being efficient or something. But i think she is the new GM and today she was asking me to do shit like clean off burn marks off those things that make food stay warm. I tried but it couldn't come off because it was worn stainless steel, not a burn. And she told me to make the whole ball room spotless and pointed out food on the wall and small fingerprints on the window and she also told me to see her when i get off because she doesnt want to lose me or something like that. I felt bad when she pointed out what needed to be cleaned. At no other job was i known as a great worker except this one. My old GM praised me. But i feel like this woman's opinion matters more because she is the new gm probably and she actually is very observant and wants everything perfect. I think maybe it might be because the thanksgiving buffet went horribly and she doesnt want the company to get more bad reviews for the event thats happening tonight, but i feel like its my time to lose my reputation and show that im actually not the most hardworking individual and I'm not the best cleaner.

242,e6mxcz,maxmynameismax,1575577152.0,2,My Sister is still in a relationship with her abusive boyfriend,"I’m not sure what to do or if I should even do anything. My sister is continuing to be in a relationship with her abusive partner and it really bothers me. They’re both in their 20s and have been together a bit over a year. 

I first heard about his behaviour a year ago, he’s been physically and verbally abusive and even pulled the hand brake on her car when they were driving on the highway, so potential deadly. 

About 6 months ago she *‘moved’* into my place because she couldn’t live with him anymore and they broke up. All or most her stuff is at my place, she has her own room but she only stays here 1 or 2 nights a week. The other nights she still stays at his. They were on a 6 month lease and she is still paying the rent there. She says she stays there because it’s closer for her work, which it is, it’s about an hour closer. But she also claims she never sees him there because he works night shift. 

She doesn’t openly say she’s still with him but everyone knows they are. Her phone back ground and social media profile pics are pictures of them two kissing. And I’ve seen messages from him pop up on her home screen phone and his name  has got love hearts next to it. She’s let it slip they still hang out and have lunches and what not. Plus obviously they still live together. 

All my family hate this guy and what nothing to do with him. My dad especially every time they see each other they fight over her relationship with him. The problem is my dad was just as abusive as her boyfriend. So she obviously doesn’t listen to a word he says and in a strange way because he was abusive she thinks this kind of behaviour is acceptable. 

I just don’t know what to do, I’ve given her a place to stay and get away, but she just goes back. If I start telling her what to do and she can’t see this guy I’m afraid I’ll just push her to him. I’m scared she’ll have a kid with him and she’ll never get rid of him or he actually seriously hurts her.

Ive look at here for 2 seconds and i return back looking at the front and this keeps on going, we go back and forth looking at each other like theres something on my face or something. She was very cute,(maybe for me), white skinned, and she looks about 157cm height and i am 165cm. If i remember correctly i was walking my way out to school gate and i was looking around while having my crush in my mind and then i looked back and she already looked at me while walking this hits me so hard like my hearts going to burst and i the adrenaline is pumping and i felt like i was going to run back home in excitement, (theres one more down below where i felt just like this) 

And on the 28 November 2017 she finally had the courage to text me about getting our prize of the best students awardsm and she congratulate me and give conplements about me and i did the same back and after that we talked back and forth about school work and some were personal. She always text me about helping her science project as i was the top of the student at science class, it was on 28 January 2018 i felt this was the longest of our conversation.

And at school it was the same for the whole year we keep staring at each other and then came 2018 the climax of my story i think it was 11am in the morning (1hr30min left before going home) there was no teacher at that time and thid time I was in the middle of the class and she was on the upper right corner of the class and she was in this sleeping position on the desk turning to the left (right hand acted like a pillow) and I (think) she is staring at me for the whole time in my peripheral vision as i was too shy to even looked at her . And then there was a fight between me and my classmates because he thought i was ""stealing"" his girlfriend who i see her as a friend, he slap my left cheek and a massive outbreak happen all this happen in front of my crush. (din't even fight back because i was having second thought) 

11 March 2019 was our last conversation on the phone and this even more makes me sad as the old staring lady she is is no more and I also try not to look at her as much as in the past. I myself an artist i drew a Potrait of her photo in a Synthetic Acrylic colour digitally and i gave it to her personally while breaktime and this makes me and her blush just like the old time, as a gift from her loyal guy crush. And i noticed through the year we only talked ""Online""
Through WhatsApp and we rarely talked in 
Reality maybe she was shy? Or i am shy? I don't know. She is not the kind of girl in the category of a ""T H O T"" she is very kind and have soft voice, and had very big eyes thats very attractive (to me). Im not trying to be a creep here im just saying. 

Can someone help me break the ice. I want the old her back just like the old time i was planning on drawing a Potrait of her again as a gift and hand it out to here by January first 2020. What are your thoughts? Maybe my story can help someone with similar situations as I did.(We are now 15 years old she is 3 months older than me 🤷🏻‍♀️)

244,e6mvwm,jumperound8,1575576990.0,0,Is my boyfriend (24) projecting on me?,"So last week, my boyfriend and I broke up. (He is 23 and I am 24 and we both go to different colleges) We had been dating for almost five years and had decided to go on a break for the whole month of November and this was about giving each other a bit of space, which was fine. But he had also brought up something that we had discussed multiple times before (and when I say multiple, i mean 3-4 times over the years) of him wanting me to go on a date so that he can “be sure I’m sure about him”? At that point I was so upset and annoyed about him asking and asking, and wanting me to do it that i finally gave into him. During this time, I don’t think that I had a whole day where I didn’t cry. I was scared and sad because I thought he had already decided that he was going to break up with me. I gave him space and kinda was in my own head during this month and we didn’t really talk a lot because. Space. So, half way through the month trying to find ways to get around having to go on a date with someone i don’t know, I went on the date.
 I met the guy at his place,  we went to dinner, and then came back to his place. We watched a movie and part way through, the guy kissed me. We made out a little and the guy tried to go further really fast. I stopped him, and I left. I didn’t feel anything at all in the kiss and realized after the kiss that I didn’t want anyone else but my boyfriend. I told my boyfriend the whole thing the next day and was excited because I was happy that i had done this and didn’t have to hear about it anymore and that I definitely had no doubts about who I wanted to be with. Later that day I messaged him, asking him how he felt about the situation because he didn’t really say anything before (this was a Sunday)  and he said “Nothing” and so i told him “okay i’m just making sure.” Since this month was about giving him space, I decided to let it go because I didn’t want to push it.

We talked on the phone a few days later and it escalated into a huge argument with him saying the kiss was cheating and upset I “wasn’t sorry.”

My friends say I’m not the asshole but his friends told him to leave me so obviously they think I’m the asshole. But idk what story they’ve heard. Because when I talked to his sister (she called me because his family LOVES me) she said he made it sound like i was happy to go on the date. And told him though he did suggest it, did not mention to her that we had this argument before. (Side note something that he had always told me is that he was scared that we would end up like his parents because his mom up and left his family one day randomly. He also told me that there were ways that he thought I acted like his mom)  but get this. His dad told his sister that he is doing the EXACT same thing that his mom did to his father. His family wants me to give up on him but I’m not ready because in a lot ways I know i went wrong. He tells me how hurt he is and I want to try and make him understand. I need some outsiders opinions, and I really want to still try and be with him because of everything we’ve been through but idk how to fix this, what should I do?",relationship_advice

My friend and I met this girl that was nice looking
Wasn't my type but she was alright

So I would often have the tendancy of joking around and be Ohh let's talk about this girl
Ohh let's send a gift to this girl

But we laugh it off and end up playing fifa

After sometime my girlfriend saw our messages and threatened to break up with me

She didn't tell me what had happened at first
She just said it was over and I was Bare confused
But then a few days afterwards her cousin told me about it 
So we all met and talked about it 
And explained that we joked around and we wouldn't ever do such a thing 
We always joke around without thinking 

But she took it as a really big deal 
And says I cheated on her 

It's been months now
And the girls name pops up in her conversations everyday
Like she'd say that I went to meet her after work
Or I'm messaging her and deleting the chats
Or talking with her in secret

Like I understand jealousy

But now it's getting frustrated

Like I don't know what to do or say anymore

I get frustrated and raise my voice a little

Then she starts crying
Saying I always hurt her and I'm a cheater

I feel so bad when she cries
And I take it in as a burden

Maybe I should think of things differently or change my ways
But I don't know
And don't know how to make it stop

She's my first love and I really love her
But right now I can't see myself keeping her happy

248,e6msxr,GodOfBeverages,1575576659.0,2,My (19M) boyfriend (21M) boyfriend broke up with me out of nowhere two weeks ago. I haven’t been the same since.,"About three weeks ago my boyfriend of two years and I got into a pretty big fight. Things were said that neither of us meant and at the end of it after seemingly having ruined our relationship, we made a commitment to each other that we would make it work for the both of us and we both seemed happy about it. 

Fast forward to that weekend, I’m out with friends and he texts me out of nowhere saying that he’s been thinking about it all week and he thinks we should see other people. That night was incredibly rough. I drove around crying and hyperventilating, not knowing what to do. The person I had spent two years with was gone. 

He said he wanted to remain friends and I told him that it would take time but I needed him to promise me that he would wait just a LITTLE bit before going and finding someone else or hooking up with other guys. He promised me. Just two days after that conversation, my friend found him on Grindr and sent me the screenshot of him advertising himself on there as available for hookups. It broke my heart again. I was so angry. After making the mistake of confronting him about it, we cut off all contact and that was that. 

I was relieved at first but sitting here now days later, my heart is still broken. I still miss him. I regret everything I said to him even if he broke a deep and trusting promise he made to me. My life has been completely thrown off. My living space is a mess. Going to the job I used to love is now just painful because it gives me too much time to think. Everything I look at reminds me of him and the breakup. I’m looking for therapists but that takes time where I’m at. I don’t know what to do. I need my life back. I need some sort of happiness back.

250,e6msdu,garbageeee93,1575576597.0,1,I miss the feeling of missing my husband?,"Using a throwaway because I don't know how to feel about this. Also don't really know if this is the right sub for this, but oh well. 

My husband and I were (kinda) long distance for the first 6 years of our relationship. We still saw each other almost every weekend. But never during the week days. We finally moved in together 2 years ago and got married last year. And I love living with him and being married to him. We get to be silly all the time and hang out in our pajamas on snow days and it's wonderful.

But I was looking through old pictures on my phone trying to find something and saw a screenshot of texts between us talking about how much we missed each other and how we couldn't wait until Friday to see each other. And I realized that while I don't miss going 5 days without seeing him every week, I do miss missing him and how excited it made me to see him. Now, I'm excited to come home at the end of the day, and it's not that I'm *not* excited to see him. But I feel like my thoughts lean more towards ""I get to go home"" than ""I get to be with my husband."" When I only got 2 days with him, I was aware of how much each minute meant. And I feel like now I take it for granted and I don't know how to stop.

In the second scenario, you still have someone around, society will accept you, but you know deep down you are not loved and only being used. 

These seem to be my options. After dating for so long, it’s obvious to me I’m not good enough, good looking enough etc for genuine love.

252,e6moii,throwaway246097,1575576190.0,1,"I’m not sure if I should hang on, end it, or how to approach either outcome. I’m stuck.","Sorry, this is a throwaway account (but not under a ThrowRA, hopefully ok!). 

I (33F) have been with my bf (33M) for just shy of 2 years. We can call him A. We fell in love very quickly, our relationship intense, since the beginning. Ups and downs. Breakthroughs and even a break. 

For context of me, I was married before, and with my ex (32M) for 7 years. I can say in that time, my ex and I had maybe 3 fights, and not comparable to what I’ve experienced in my current relationship with A. My ex and I ended peacefully, cheering over drinks, and agreeing to continue to always stay family. We each walked away with just what we brought to the relationship, and since he went through a bigger move, I agreed to help financially for a little while until he was on his feet. We still talk regularly. This is a great story for another time, but while I know I was lucky because all relationships are not that...difficulties like I’m having with my current partner, A, are not as familiar to me. Before my ex husband, I’d end something almost immediately at the distant sighting of a red flag - I didn’t have time. 

A has been in 3x the number of relationships as me and/or 3x the partners. Never lived with a/n SO, and had one long term relationship (just over a year). They sort of lived together, but still had separate places. Majority of his relationships sound tumultuous or just boring from his perspective when sharing insight with me and they ended soon. Frequently he has told me he’s mostly found all of his past gf’s annoying. 

Furthermore, A comes from a wealthy picturesque family - prep schools, college paid for (5 years+ and current changes of heart paid for at 32/33), dancing monkey at his 9th birthday, trips, living abroad at one point, parents paying cars off as gifts at 33. He still has an allowance. 50/50, I find this amazing to have such a supportive family but I also find it bewildering because...

I am somewhat estranged. My mother died when I was a baby, my father was abusive, but kept us for assistance. I started working at 15 to pay bills and get medical/dental care for myself, and to plan my escape. I didn’t have birthday parties or graduation parties. I bought my first junky gas-leaking car at 15 to drive to more work the day I got my license. I graduated high school early, and I was out the door at 18. I started a career, I paid and worked my way through college night classes. I own a home, I own my car now, I have 0 student loans. 

Disparity in our upbringing is apparent and frequently a topic of contribution in conversations about our different outlooks on things in life and morals, but not a deal breaker between us. 

A can be a very loving, fun person (especially with a drink or two)...but frequently goes through extreme hot/cold spells which confuse me. I never know where I stand and never feel emotionally safe or at peace with A. When I have mentioned this, he explains not everyone can be “on” all the time. I also understand. A is more introverted, I am extroverted. We have persisted to work through some of these things and understand each other’s needs and boundaries because there is love there. 

There have been 3 larger not-so-truthful things (on A’s part). One by omission (a child in another country that he says is not his, but his family thinks is and they originally leaked it to me - it’s a cluster), one as straightforward as they come (lied about something unnecessarily, got caught, fessed up), and another in something we had communicated was hurtful to me but A continued to do it anyway and repeatedly denied it. Each time I have tried to understand how A must feel, how he has responded/justified, and to be fair with my forgiveness. He has a particularly good way of presenting to me that what I am feeling isn’t necessarily valid to the situation or the big picture. His outlook is there are times that it’s not needed to share everything, and when it’s time, it will happen. To me, transparency is important to build trust and honesty has no fuzzy lines. 

As I mentioned, because there is love and care there, though...I have persisted with hopes to make things work and look beyond differences. I love the good times and I hold dearly, maybe too much, onto those. So...in April/May of this year, he moved in with me. It just made sense at the time. A was practically living here and it seemed silly wasting the money and time to go drop a rent check for his apartment, while I own my home. Anyway....since then, small things continue to present themselves to me at a shocking rate...small things compared to those 3 not-so-truthful things mentioned above...and they appear to be compiling into one bigger problem. I think he’s a good person...but he has some character traits that make me uncomfortable.

He can laugh intensely at the expense or pain of others. He can talk negatively of others easily. He can make fun of me or others in front of friends/family. He cannot be bothered before noon most days. He is quick to anger and always defensive. He sometimes seems as though he genuinely loathes me one moment and loves me another. Admittedly, there are times when he sees my discomfort or concern... and he genuinely looks apologetic or even apologizes. Also to be fair, I’m no angel. I tend to shell up and not engage when I feel put-off. I freeze when he gets angry at me (this a known product of my childhood, and I try to acknowledge it). I get frustrated when he accidentally breaks things that belong to me (especially when I know he will not fix or replace). I get frustrated when he sleeps until 2 in the afternoon. I can be tough-love when stress is high. I am often go, go, go. I have some high expectations. I know that can be a lot/too much for people.

We’ve talked about the possibility of ending things before and he has plainly said he cannot move out for a few months if we do because he cannot afford to. This was the first thing to come up when we talked about it — not trying to make it work, but how he was stuck. I can’t help but feel like when he says that, he doesn’t want this either but needs me for now. He pays me a small rent. 1/3 of only my home payment, no utilities, no consumables, etc. and it’s 40% less than his bills when he lived alone. I think his allowance basically covers our agreed amount. He gets some groceries and will treat me to dinner here and there. I have offered to let him stop paying in the event, and save to leave and he’s still persisted that it would take a couple months. Some of me feels this is his way of trying to let me know he wants to work it out with me without saying it in those words. He’s very proud. When I asked if he’s ok with us ending, he says no, he doesn’t want it to end, loves me, and wants to be with me. I see the potential when conversations have deepened to this level and I see small changes on his part afterward. I acknowledge him for them and express appreciation. 

So, I’m at this point...

When things continue to arise that are questionable or hurtful, I don’t want to discuss them anymore. I’m exhausted and I don’t want to exhaust him. I don’t think it’s worth it. I love him...but I just don’t think the love is enough to keep it together for much longer. I’m not getting any younger, nor is he, and I would rather see us each go be able to live our happiness. Sadly, I just still see ‘us’ in my happiness and at our happiest. Maybe I’m just “too in it”. Being his longest relationship...he has indicated multiple times he wants to marry and be with me long term in life. I don’t know that I can do it, though...and it’s heartbreaking. I don’t like living as a partial version of myself when I feel like I started our relationship out there in a beautiful place - loving myself and my life, able to be open, and I’ve been bullied into suppressing so much of me to make someone else more comfortable. Even things I was passionate about he has told me are silly efforts and a waste when he used to love them about me. I’d like to get back there to that place with him, but it seems impossible and I’m not sure how to go forward to get somewhere better either.

Since I am seemingly on the fence/stuck... on where this could go...I would really appreciate any advice/thoughts from others who are unbiased...input on my approach...anything. 

Thank you to anyone for reading my very winded post, I know we all have our own things happening in this crazy ride of life and this may seem superficial for some (understandably), but other input/perspective means a lot to me. Apologies for any grammatical errors.

My(33f), Bf (33m) of almost 2yrs. lives with me is a lot of what I want in a partner and some of what I don’t. Love and potential is there, but it may not be the best fit long term and feels like it’s reaching a checkmate. Not sure what to do.",relationship_advice

So some background: My dad died a year and a half ago. My boyfriend and I were living with our own parents and have a child and he moved in when my dad died to help us out. We couldn’t afford the house we were in so my mom (58), my boyfriend (20), my son (2) , and I (22) moved into an apartment. It’s been downhill since. 

My mom told us that we would get an apartment, sell the house, and then use the money from the house to get a new one when the lease was up. Cool. She got $50k and then decided she wanted to keep all the money for herself to retire or whatever and said we have to come up with equal money to put down. I’m not too upset, it was her and my dads house, it’s her money, it’s whatever. I’m upset about her saying one thing and doing another but I’ve never held it against her or said anything about it. 

My boyfriend, J, on the other hand is pissed. He said she promised and now she’s sitting on this money and all my dads 401ks and telling us to fuck ourselves and he’s upset. He’s back and forth on decisions and wants a house but we don’t have the savings to buy one.  

Okay now onto my problem: J and my mom recently have been arguing. About little things here and there and I’m over it. I get calls at work or texts or I come home to immediate stress from this. Whether she doesn’t like how he parents to him not liking her trying to parent him. Its everything, I try to remain calm and help problem solve but it’s causing so much more stress. J said my mom and I gang up on him, when I just typically ask that he stop arguing or saying what he is “joking” about isn’t funny so they just stop arguing. I don’t ever say he’s wrong or take a side or anything in front of my mom. I say “that’s not funny” or “please stop so we can go upstairs” or something to get him and her to just stop. I’ve tried to help them with working through whatever they’re arguing on. They both continue to find new things to blow up about. 

J wants to move out on our own. I get it. I don’t want to leave my mom on her own, but she would be fine financially and we’ve talked about it. J has a nice job but isn’t mature with his finances. I can’t afford anything now. I can’t, I’m broke and I make barely above minimum wage and get government assistance to stay afloat. J and I split all the bills, groceries, and everything for our son evenly and it leaves me with $50ish extra dollars a month, while he spends his extra money on everything he needs and wants. I’m not complaining about that, I just know that I’m struggling financially now, if we moved out I would have a full blown mental breakdown trying to keep up. 

I don’t want to stay here and cause more stress for everyone and lose my great relationship with my mom. I don’t want to lose J either. What should I do?",relationship_advice

She told me when we started dating that when she was around 10 yrs old she was abused by a couple members of her family. At that point i had already met most of her family. She assured me that she has moved on from it and the people who did it to her have made drastic changes in their lives. She also told me that although i have met them before, they werent people she encounters very often at all. She has a large family all around the country so i assumed it was somebody far away from us. However, she wouldnt tell me who it was because of everything i just mentioned. This never bothered me, I figured she would tell me whenever shes ready. 

Well she told the whole truth about it and its a lot more than she let on. It was an uncle and her cousin  (the cousin is female if that matters). They were both around 18 yrs old when they did it. These arent people i rarely see, these are people who i see all the time and have built relationships with. This made me feel kind of sick to my stomach that i had been friendly with the people who abused my gf. She calmed my emotions by reminding me everyone has changed since then. 
I thought about it for a minute and i only had one follow up question. I asked her how did your family deal with that situation so well because everything seems fine now. She said only her mom and the cousins mom even know it happened. I tried to hold back emotions when she told me that but i guess my face said it all because she instantly knew i was emotional when i heard that. I asked her if she ever told her dad about what happened and she said no (her dad and her uncle are really good friends and they do a lot together). I asked if the mother of her uncles 2 kids know about it and she said no. I told her that they never made any drastic changes in their lives because they just got away with it. I was expecting her to get defensive when i said that but she actually agreed with me. she said shes not going to do anything because her family is in a good spot and she doesnt want to ruin that. 

I dont know what to do. I love my girlfriend very much, but i dont know what to do with this information. How do I attend another one of their family functions with this in my head.

We are still talking and working towards getting back together eventually but I want to forgive myself for what happened before I go back into a relationship (because he and I kinda decided that we would basically restart in a sense). I don’t want to go into any relationship with this on my back, especially if there’s a chance it could be messed up with him again. I want to see a counselor, but I’m not sure if I should tell him. We’ve definitely been way more open and honest with each other than we had been before. But I don’t want him to think I’m trying to make him feel bad in any way.

259,e6mknq,Neshy05,1575575752.0,0,Me and my girlfriend,"In my school there is this girl that I really liked and let’s just say her name is G and basically the both of us became really good friends and shit and after about 3 months of knowing her I asked her out and she rejected me because she already had a boyfriend (which was true at the time) but later on after about 3 months she broke up with him and I connected with G a lot more and by September she asked me out kinda. Now I’m currently in a relationship with her. And I’ve had a crush on her for about a year now and I think after about 3 months into the relationship that I love her.
But today she talked to me and addressed something that was up with me . Basically throughout the relationship I kept asking her if she wanted to be in a relationship and if she really liked me because even after she got into a rs with me her behavior was extremely inconsistent. And she also mentioned that she really wasn’t a very cuddly person and that whenever I hug her she always feels slightly uncomfortable sometimes. She also said the she wanted to take this relationship slow and I understand that but 3 months in I love her so much m. I am a very affectionate person and I am clingy but not the point of it being bad. I do have a lot of anxiety about all this and she’s on my mind almost always. The furthest we have gotten in this rs is kissing and that too only only on the neck and cheek. She says that our relationship is going too fast for her liking and she wants me to stop with stupid questions that I’ve been asking her a lot and also because she’s answered them plenty of times. Today was my birthday and she didn’t wish me because she thought it was the next day and idm that but I did the mistake of asking if she really did care about me and that I was important to her. And asking these questions to her is pissing her off. She also said that I’m taking this relationship too seriously like the both of us are going to be together forever. I don’t mean to say she’s wrong about me taking it seriously but I would like to hope that we could stay together for atleast a few years. 
I want to show my love to her and but idk how without hurting her. 
Can someone give me advice on what I should do?

I love him so much but I'm really just starting to see him more as a best friend than a boyfriend and I feel terrible making him feel inadequate for me as he is very loving and tries his best to make me happy. Our main issue together is I feel sometimes he just doesn't listen to me when I tell him what I need from our relationship (listening to me, keeping boundaries of our personal life with friends, had an issue with talking over me etc). I also really realized I've given up certain dreams I've had to build more of a life with him but I'm starting to feel as though I will regret/ resent him for not completing my goals. Anyway I'm positive he can feel me being distant as we had a bit of an argument earlier this week but I really feel like I checked out emotionally afterward and can't get back to how we were + a lot of his mannerisms have started to annoy me more than they used to.

I Can't get away from my EX,"My exBF (M 22) was very manipulative, would throw fits of rage (smashing presents I got him when we had fights, calling me names, get jealous of me having out with my guy friends or tomboys). The ultimate reason we broke up is because he was upset that I was going to a party and we had talked about it 10-15 times (20-30 minute convos). Like any natural human being, I was very frustrated. We met up one final time to talk about it and it all went to shit. Resulted in me crying in a parking lot, abandoned by him, waiting for an Uber to pick me up because he didn't want to drop me home after the EXPLOSIVE argument where he grabbed my face and called me names. He is very insecure and often his insecurities got the better of him. 

Eventually our families had to get involve to cut us off from contacting each other, but he kept on reaching out and confessing his feelings, telling me he's sorry, etc. He even threatened self harm. So many of my friends have warned me again seeing him again but for some reason i can't get the idea of being with him out of my head. He recently messaged me again on a random number he got (and i thought it was a wrong number mistake) and proceeded to message me again about how much he loves me and how ""I was the one for him"" and how ""he's going to change"" (I gave him 4 other chances throughout our 1.5 year relationship).

He keeps on wanting to talk to me, will find me on campus at our university to talk about his life while I try to ignore his presence. He even tells me about all the hookups he's had in the past couple of weeks in order to elicit a reaction from me. I just want to live my life and am TIRED of these pesky feelings that come up every time I see him because I did love him at one point before things got bad. I always tend to see the good in people. 

 How do I keep myself positive and happy during this tough time. My friends say I'm too nice and I give in too easily Any advice? I just get anxiety or feel sad every time I think about it.

How do I navigate this?,"My SO and I have been together for about a year and a half. We are planning on moving in together next July, when we’ll have been together for two years. My mother is difficult in many respects, but she’s been outright unbearable in response to my decision to move in with my boyfriend. Her primary reason is that “it’s against our religion,” which it is, but so is getting divorced when you find you aren’t compatible live in partners with someone. She’s called me an embarrassment to the family, among other names, any time I’ve brought it up, and constantly reminds me how disgraceful I am for doing this. 

Both my boyfriend and I see this as a step towards getting engaged, and we’ll have been together for a good amount of time before moving in together. Our primary reasons for doing this are taking a step in our relationship towards engagement, being able to get a nicer/larger place to live without either of us paying a significant amount more so that we are able to save money, overall practical considerations such as taking two cars places and the hassle of splitting our time between two residents, and overall just wanting to. Besides, it’s much easier to save up for a wedding/engagement ring/honeymoon etc. if we’re splitting living expenses!!! Both of us are successful adults with good careers, he a physician and me an attorney. I’ve articulated these reasons to my mom, but she continues on with how it’s against our religion and how she never would do it and whatnot. 

My boyfriend doesn’t feel quite ready for us to get engaged before then, and I’m perfectly okay with that. I don’t want to pressure him into that step before he’s ready, and since I’m pretty sure I want to be with him forever, I don’t see any particular rush! We’ve discussed my only concern about moving in together and having the relationship stop progressing, i.e. we live together a really long time without being engaged, and he’s said that’s definitely not something he wants either and abated that concern. 

How do I navigate this situation? 

TLDR: Boyfriend and I are moving in together next summer. Mom vocally doesn’t agree because it’s contrary to our religion. Not sure how to navigate the situation.

ETA: I wouldn’t alter my decision based upon her ideas about this. I mostly need advice on responding, as well as just overall avoiding it from getting under my skin.",relationship_advice
267,e6mcu3,anon8af,1575574867.0,152,HELP!! I think my (22F) boyfriend (22M) slept with my engaged sister (26F),"Using a throwaway because my boyfriend uses reddit and knows my main account.

Anyway, I went on vacation with my family including my newly engaged sister. Her fiancé couldn’t come along because of work obligations, but my boyfriend of around 8 months was able to make it. 

We stayed at a resort in Cabo, so there were 2 conjoined rooms. My parents and younger brother stayed in one room, and my sister, boyfriend and I stayed in the other room. There was a pull out couch for my sister and then my boyfriend and I slept on the bed. It wasn’t a big deal that we shared a room, we were just excited to go on vacation. I’m also pretty close with my sister even though with live about 4 hours away from each other.

Anyway, we went to dinner one night and my parents like to party. We all ended up pretty drunk, and around 10pm my sister wanted to go back to the room and go to bed. She was pretty trashed, but not as bad as I’ve seen her before. My parents didn’t want her walking back to the room alone, so my boyfriend offered to walk her there and then come back. My parents were pleased and I was happy because it seemed like such a nice thing for him to do, and it made him look good in the eyes of my family. 

They left around 10:30pm, and my parents, little brother, and I stayed to drink and hang out. The walk to the room would take about 8-10 minutes, maybe more for a super drunk person. However, my boyfriend wasn’t that drunk and I expected him to hurry back. When 11:00 rolled around I started to get worried. I mentioned this to my parents, but they didn’t want me to go to the room alone and urged me to wait for them. I agreed, but I wasn’t happy about it.

I texted my boyfriend at 11:15 and asked where he was and if he wanted to walk on the beach before we went to bed. We hadn’t gotten much alone time, and we only had one more day of vacation. He didn’t reply to me until 11:37 and he said “sounds good, I’m heading back soon.” I asked him what he was doing, and he told me my sister was throwing up so he was putting her to bed. This is when I started to get suspicious, because I’ve seen my sister much more drunk than that yet not throwing up.

He finally showed up back to the restaurant/bar at around midnight. He was wearing the same clothes as before, but I just had a feeling. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to cause a scene in front of my parents, especially if I was wrong, but the feeling was still there. We ended up hanging out with my parents for about another hour, and then we decided it was too late for a walk and we all headed back to our rooms. When I walked in, my sister was sleeping in her pajamas under the covers on her pull out couch. I thought that was weird because if she was so plastered she was throwing up, I have no idea how she could’ve been able to undress, take her makeup off, and put on pajamas. Unless my boyfriend put on her pajamas. Either way, something was fishy. 

I decided to not say anything and just go to sleep, as I was a bit drunk myself. I went to the bathroom and took my makeup off, and I decided to look through the trash. It was about halfway full but at the bottom, there was a used condom. My boyfriend and I don’t use condoms as I have an IUD. I was absolutely livid and so hurt. I turned on the shower and sat in the bathroom crying until I assumed my boyfriend had fallen asleep. 

We just got back from vacation and I still haven’t said anything to my parents or boyfriend or sister. I was being cold to them on the trip home, but they just assumed I was crabby from the lack of sleep. 

I just need to figure out how I should approach this. Should I ask my sister? Can I even forgive her? Obviously I need to break up with my boyfriend, but I don’t know how to bring it up, and then what do I tell my parents???? I’m so lost here and I just feel drained.

271,e6m9rs,sherilyn3,1575574529.0,1,29M/29F Advice on a new long distance military relationship,"My boyfriend ships out to basic training next month. We have only been together for a few months, but both at a point of our lives in which we feel confident and excited to take on this next adventure/challenge together. I plan to write him daily while he is at basic training. I found an app which will print & send letters for me the same day, so that makes it easy. I told him that he could write me when he can, as I know he will be physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted.

After basic training, I will hopefully attend his graduation, and then he will go to school across the street in Great Lakes, Illinois. We plan to video chat daily or every other day and use a calendar to keep track. We will also text when we can, as normal, of course. We don't know his schedule yet and there will also be a time difference, but we will figure it out as soon as we know. 

We plan to wait until he gets decent liberty, and then I will start visiting once a month over the weekend/long weekend. He will visit home during holiday leave. I also plan to send packages here and there. Once he finished school, we plan to get married, I will go where he goes. 

Neither of us have been in a long distance or military relationship before, so I'm sure there will be plenty of learning curves. I'm sure we will learn a lot and adjust a lot along the way. 

Assuming we do get married and/or bridge the distance once he graduates school, we will be apart for about a year or so. 

I have a fulfilling life with friends and hobbies here, and will keep those up while we are apart.

She told the entire school about my social anxiety which I’d rather keep secret and every time a boy tried to talk to me she would always mention how awkward, weird and annoying I was.

Luckily I’ve now moved a couple of hours away from her and I’ve made great friends, but she’s still taunting me and now she’s started to spread my number around to random guys because she thinks it’s funny when I clearly don’t like it and it makes me kind of worried since I have no idea who these people are. She also managed to get in contact with a guy that lives in my town and gave him my address which I don’t know how she managed to find since she can’t see my snap map nor have I ever told her.

Most of you will probably say to just block her when I ask how to stop her from doing this, but it’s very hard because: 
1. I’m very much of a people pleaser and don’t want to make anyone upset, gives me guilt and anxiety.
2. She’s (kind of) psycho.

I did NOT plan it and did not even like him romantically at first but somehow we ended up connecting for the first two days I was in his city. I had to leave to go to my next destination so we had to part ways. I ended up spending just 2 nights in the next city I went to and then left to go back to be with him.

So after I left to continue with my trip we both realized we couldn’t spend more than a week without seeing each other so he changed the trip he was on (Paris) to come visit me 5 hours away in the city that I was in at the time and we spent another 4 days together. All amazing. So neither of us discussed anything related to “what are we,” we were just enjoying each other’s company.

He then responds with, “why are you being like this?” and I respond with, “I was joking.” Which, this is the nature of my humour, and I think it’s obvious that I was joking. Anyway, long story short, he has not messaged me since exchanging those last words for a week and this fact alone makes me really upset to think about.

I have been working in industry and started a graduate program since then.

I had a handful of good professors, but one really stuck out. I was dealing with undiagnosed and untreated mental health problems and his class was probably the most difficult class I’ve taken, including my grad classes thus far (different university). I’ve gone to office hours and burst into tears just trying to ask course related questions because my mental health was just... not good. I was open with him about it, and I did try, and I think he knew that, but if he remembers me that’s probably why. To be clear, there was no preferential treatment, but he was patient and did his best to help me.

The thing is, the content in his class is what I was most excited about it, and although I was a subpar student, I learned way more than I expected to. I’m currently working in industry, directly using and expanding on the knowledge I learned in his class.

Every few months since I graduated, I’ve wanted to send an email just thanking him for the class and the grace he showed me because I have no doubt that it’s what got me my dream job.

Is there a way to write this email so that it *doesn’t* come off as weird?** I don’t want anything, and I don’t anticipate needing anything from him in the future, so it feels like the right response to an email like this would be “okay, and?” - which is what’s kept me from drafting more than half of it, let alone hitting send.

tldr; Is there a non-weird way to send a thank you email to a professor after 2 years?",relationship_advice

 As the title suggests my GF and I recently got into a argument about where I spend Christmas. I want to spend Christmas with my family, and she wants to have a Christmas with just her and I. My logic is this: I only have a limited amount of Christmases I can spend with them at home left. My parents are getting old, I'm getting older, and soon I don't think I'll be able to go over there for Christmas, and I want to take advantage of it while I can. Christmas with my family is something that is important to me because I only get to see them once every few months, and never for very long, and It's kind of the last remnant I still have of being a kid and whatnot, which I know is kind of silly.  She's is upset that I want to do this, and wants to have a Christmas with just the two of us. I invited her to Christmas with my family, but she doesn't get along too well with them (they just make her very anxious, and she's kind of shy) and so she says that she doesn't want to. She also doesn't really have family of her own to have Christmas with. I told her that I just want to have a few more Christmases with my family while I'm still young and a ""kid"" before I commit to having a totally separate Christmas. She said this made her feel like I'm putting her on the back burner. My question is: Am I in the wrong for wanting to still go home for Christmas? What would be a good compromise?

It was always me planning dates, asking to hangout, trying to see him. And we always had an amazing time so I was blind to it for a while. But it began to weigh on me. So I talked to him about it. 

He said he understood how i felt like it was one sided so he’d try and reach out more. But I was stupid and didn’t let him ever prove it. I kept doing what I was doing. Kept suggesting plans and we kept having a great time. 

We had to have a second discussion a few months later. I  care about him, I have feelings for him. He says he cares about me too but said he wasn’t looking to have a girlfriend. He of course enjoys our time together and wants to continue to do so, but he’s applying to grad school, he’s unhappy at work but has nowhere to go, he’s unhappy at home (he’s living in a 3bedroom apt with 7 people) he’s the only one with his own room so his mom asked him to pay rent. He said he wanted to continue seeing me if I could accept that he couldn’t give me more than he was currently giving. I was the typical girl who hoped over time things would change.

Things were ok again for a little while but I was still holding on to wanting him and it all come flooding out last night. So we got on the phone. He said he’s different in a relationship. He becomes consumed with having to deal with “us” instead of just himself. He has to be conscious of how he interacts with people so nothing comes across as flirting or disrespectful to me rather than just being himself. He can’t be responsible for someone else’s feelings when he isn’t happy. He told me before he wasn’t interested in making this more. The thought had occurred to him before, because he did see me as more than a friend. But it’s just not in line with what he wants for his life right now. He asked if we should stop being intimate if its going to continuously make me sad. 

I know logically I have no other choice. I can’t continue to sleep with someone I want but has told me he won’t give me that. But we were friends before all this so he doesn’t want to lose that. I asked if he could even manage to put effort into a friendship and got a wishy washy answer. 

I cried all night. My face is swollen and I don’t know how to move forward. I don’t want to date anyone else, I don’t want to kiss or touch anyone else, i don’t want to smell anyone else or get to know someone knew.

How do I deal with this feeling? How do I stop crying. How do I still see him at work and know that we both care for each other?",relationship_advice
282,e6m1m1,cherrim98,1575573618.0,3,I (20M) feel harassed by a woman (34F) online.,"So this one is kind of a story.

&#x200B;

I was on instagram and I get a DM from a woman who randomly texted me out of nowhere. I was genuinely confused of why but I asked who she was and if she needed anything? She says she just ""wanted to chat"" and asked how old I was. I told her I was 20, and she said she was 34. And my first thought after that is ""why are you messaging me?""

She then tells me a bit about herself, saying she has a kid and she was recently divorced and is really traumatized by it and it's difficult for her because she has to raise the kid by herself. So I genuinely felt bad for her and tried to console her.

Then she then asks if I use Google Hangouts, so I give her my username on their and then she starts talking to me there. (Then shortly after, her Insta gets deleted... suspicious.)

She then asks if I am interested in a relationship and I tell her no because I wouldn't be interested in dating someone whom I never met before. (Also, btw she allegedly lives in Michigan and I live in New Jersey.) She then proceeds to kind of guilt me into dating her... Saying ""I am the only one who talks to her."" (Even though I don't really respond that much anyway.) Then she keeps calling me ""dear,"" ""hun,"" and ""baby."" Then she starts asking for pictures of myself and I start to feel uncomfortable, because I already have a S.O. as well and this doesn't feel right.

Then the day after she messages me and starts telling me that if we're gonna date she told her kid that and that if we start I have to give her $50 a month. I said ""no way, Jose"" and like I wasn't even trying to date anyway! Why is she assuming I am going to date her? I am 20 and she is 34! Then she also said that she would fly down to visit me but only if I pitch in basically 75% of the plane ticket.I told her no. Like I am a college student, I am broke! Also I don't know who this woman is who she says she is so I don't trust her. I already told her that I don't recommend we talk anymore because it's not right for her but she still says ""okay talk to you later."" and like messages me at 4:30am saying ""I miss you."" and starts calling me. Like lady, I don't mean to be rude to you but you're really starting to make me uncomfortable.

But that's the issue. What if she's who she says she is and has like no friends. I don't wanna be rude to her and do something to hurt her feelings. I don't know what to do. I feel kind of harassed but I don't want to be rude about it...

283,e6m1gv,ifinallyhavewifi,1575573600.0,7,Every girl I've (m25) been with has been unfaithful - dealing with trust issues,"Pretty much the title. Throughout my life so far I've had 4-5 serious/long-term relationships (depending on what qualifies as serious - 4 of the 5 were over 6 months) and a few flings here and there, and almost all of my romantic endeavors (bar 1) have ended in unfaithfulness on the other's part, sadly, with the exception of the most recent one, who broke it off due to my unhealthy relationship boundaries.

&#x200B;

These infidelities range from the more innocent (hooking up/making out with other dudes at a party (yours truly, my first high school girlfriend)) to blatantly cheating multiple times, exposing me to syphilis, and lying to my face about being sexually assaulted/drugged so I wouldn't get my feelings hurt over being cheated on  (ending an over two-year relationship, my second to most recent relationship).

&#x200B;

As you can imagine, all of this has given me some pretty bad trust issues; I tanked my most recent relationship with a pretty amazing person because I let anxiety rule my life and our relationship. We dated a little over a year and recently split up amicably because the relationship was becoming toxic for the both of us (a lot of my doing); it breaks my heart because I know despite my flaws, she was someone I could really see a future with.

&#x200B;

Now I'm left picking up the pieces and making sense of all of this. I'm finding it hard to seriously think about opening up intimately to anyone again, whether it be romantic or merely platonic, and really struggle to see the good in people. My life has essentially become: wake up, go to 9-5 job, come home, play video games for a few hours or watch tv, go to sleep, repeat. On a day to day basis I have very little real human connection and to be honest I don't find myself wanting it (maybe out of fear), though I know I'm obviously depressed and this is unhealthy.

On occasion we meet up on a weekday and grab dinner & a movie. I work 30-45 minutes away from where we meet and she works 1hr-1hr 15 minutes away depending on traffic. I understand it can take her longer to get in and she can't control traffic however the pattern is normally as follows:
We make plans that are 3-4 days away and S says we'll meet at 18:00.
The day of the plans S asks can we meet at 18:30, I agree because I can just stay longer in work and with enough notice I don't mind a little later. As this has happened so many times I expect our plans to actually be at 18:30 and not 18:00.
18:30 comes around, I text her that I'm here and waiting for her. S replies saying she'll be another 20 minutes, which eventually turns into 30+ minutes and she goes radio silent until she's about 5 minutes out.

I routinely spend 30-45 just waiting for her and I'm not too sure how to express how much I am annoyed by this.  I once waited an hour and 20 minutes for her. S is aware that I don't like to make plans very late and won't normally agree to meet past 19:00 as I want to be home by 22:00 or if we're seeing a movie 23:00. Today, we were to meet at 18:00, which turned into 18:30, then to 18:45 and at 18:50 I get a text saying she'll be another 20 minutes. It's now 19:20 and no sign of her and no response to messages.

S is always very apologetic but I feel like I'm being forced into staying out later than I would normally agree and that she has no regard for my time.

285,e6lywq,TaZjec,1575573315.0,1,How do you deal with long-distance relationships? (M21),"First a quick rundown: 

A girl(F20) I sorta kinda knew through my best friend from my home city texted me about a month ago.

We met in a major city near me cause she was here over a weekend and we went to see a movie and all went well so the week after she invited me over to the city she studies in (about a 4-5h trip from where I live). All went very well, maybe even a tad bit faster than I expected but hey, ain't gonna complain. I went there again last week and this week we're hopefully meeting in my home city (6h trip). 

The distance and all isn't tragically long, nor do I particularly mind the train rides to meet with her on the weekends. 

I just really struggle with the separation on the weekdays as I definitely am a type of person to attach very quickly and strongly and with that comes (hopefully) unwarranted jaelousy. I'm worried every time she isn't texting me when she goes out with her male friends and in some cases even exes and friends she used to sleep with or slept with. I might be taking that too harshly as I never was the type to pursue sex at all cost, even if I might have had the opportunities and maybe my values are somewhere else than they should be. (was a virgin till the first weekend over at her place, ye i know, embarrassing). There definitely is a big difference in this regard between us but hopefully that's not as tragic as I might think it is, sure isn't helping though.

She unfirtunatelly has been diagnosed with chronic depressions at a very young age and has been struggling and dealing with those for a long time, but she's been doing pretty well from what I know untill she moved to the city where she studies atm, as she lives there alone and has to take care of not only the university but the life itself. I really struggle with the fact I cannot be there for her when she might need it and the fact I cannot go see her at my whim has really been beating down on me quite radically. 

If anyone has any tips and experience with LDR or what to focus at at times of separation, here with it.

I'm a 18 year's old boy and I am desperate for some help. Let's start at the beginning. I met a 17 year old girl on my vacation job and we had a really fun time there so things got a little bit more serious. We came there to just go with as many people as we wanted but left with wanting nobody else but each other. She likes me I like her it's as simple as that but she lives far away (3 hours with the train). And I don't have allot of time and she neither so meeting eachother isn't really a option in the weekends. So vacations would maybe work. 

The problem is I mis her very much and I want to talk with her allot but she doesn't start conversations with me I always have to start it. I know she misses me to but when I trie to contact her I need to wait a few hours to get a response and that's really annoying if I just want to have a conversation. So that doesn't work. I told her that I didn't want to lose her but I was sending allot of messages on Snapchat trying to keep her interested in me. And she eventually said it's annoying that I am sending so many snaps and that I need to play ""hard to get"" to keep it interesting. How tf am I supposed to do that. Now I almost don't send her anything anymore I just keep distance but she doesn't start anything. I am desperate I don't know what to do she wants to meet up in her vacation so that's great. But I just can't talk with her and I want to so bad.

Let me introduce you to some context:
I live in a foreign country with my partner. We have to moved out from our home country because of politics and social issues and we have been living here for almost 4 years. Last year, my partner decided to bring his parents to live with us because of the same social and political reasons, something which I don’t had (and still don’t have) any problem. I like to live with my parents-in-law, they’re both lovely and quiet. We live together in a mid-sized apartment and we’re very comfortable. But there’s a thing I can’t stand anymore.

My MIL is whistling all the fucking time. From the beginning of the day until night. She is fucking whistling and singing while she cooks, do crafts, etc., and this is driving me crazy. I work on weekends, so sometimes I take one or two days inside the week to rest and I can’t do that because she’s whistling so loudly since 7AM. When I do home office I can’t concentrate because she’s singing. I can’t watch TV or listen to my own music because she’s also whistling very, VERY loudly. It’s unbearable.

I don’t know how to approach to her or my partner and tell them about this issue. I don’t want her to feel unwelcomed and I don’t want my partner to think I’m grumpy.

TL;DR: I live with my MIL and she’s whistling and singing very loudly ALL DAY and it’s riving me crazy. I don’t know how to tell her to stop.",relationship_advice

this post is mostly about strategic (and maybe legal) advice, given that I am a migrant in this country and so far I haven't been able to talk to a real lawyer. They don't answer my calls or reply to my messages. So I was wondering if anyone else has gone through such a situation and might be able to give me adice. 

I've been with my wife since 2013, she's from the US, I'm from an European country. We met in my hometown and fell in love. Yet the long distance thing broke us up twice during that time. I missed her terribly though and wanted to be with her. And since she was not coming under any circumstances to  my country to live there permanently (beause of wanting to be close to her family and better health care (according to her) because she has some medical issues), I packed my bags in the beginning of 2019 and moved to the US.

We got married this summer, out of love, but also out of necessity, so I would sooner be able to work and travel. Once I finally got my permit to work and leave the country, I booked a vacation trip back to my hometown to see family and friends. Once being there, I realized how unhappy I am in the states, and how badly our relationship is going. I have no friends or family here and it's been hard to get to know people. And if I want to do something with her, she is always tired. Coming home felt like being reborn. I was finally happy again.

And then I did something terrible. While going out with friends, there was this new girl (27F, from another EU-country) in the group and we immediatly hit it off. Of course I told her I was married, and later that night, when I got a little flirtier and grabbed her waist once, she even told me gently to back off, because of my wife. So nothing happened that night, but a week later I saw her again. And then it happened. First we kissed, then I went home to her place. Of course, the whole physical part was amazing. But we also talked, and I realized that I was really into her in other senses as well. 

We met two more times during my stay (we didn't have more time as I was heading back to the US) and it was just amazing. I left my homecountry with a lot of pain. Feeling incredibly guilty for what I've done to my wife and marriage, and already missing the other woman. 

This all happened about a month ago. Me and the other F are still talking. Every day. At least an hour on the phone, countless texts back and forth each day. I'm falling for her and she is falling for me. Yet even if it wouldn't work out between me and her, I already know that my marriage is beyond salvaging now. I haven't been happy, and I fucked up. My wife would never forgive me. So I have to get a divorce and move back to my country. 

Yet here is where I am asking for advice: I have no idea about the legal consequences in this case, and I need advice on how to handle it. If I admit that I'm having an affair, will I be punished in the court because it is my fault that the marriage ended (which I acknowledge)?, Would I be forced to pay something to my exwife? The thing is, I basically have nothing and live of her and her parents. I wasn't able to work for about a year because I didn't have the permission, and so my savings are almost used up. I dont' want to get in debt because of this, even though I might deserve it. 

Or would it be better to hide the affair from her until the divorce is finalized, legally speaking? 

Also, I am aware that I will cause terrible pain to my wife when I tell her that I want to divorce her, and I am torn if I will make it worse with telling her about the affair or if it would actually easier for her because she would hate me so much more and might let go more easily. 

So please reddit, what should I do? 

Tl;dr: I moved to the US and got married to be with my wife. Once back in my homecountry, I realized how unhappy I was. In addition, I fell for another woman. Now I want to divorce my wife and move back to my homecountry, but am torn about telling her about the affair or keep quiet about it, also because of legal consequences.

I’m about to lose my mind and my issue is a little more complex than the title alludes. I was approached by a friend/colleague a year ago who pitched me hard in joining the team over at her work. We have the same education and credentials and overall the same amount of experience in the field; I may have more experience in some areas. It doesn’t matter, the point is we are equals in our workplace. The pitch sounded amazing and in our field it’s hard to find a small work setting with work/home life balance. It’s small so it’s my boss/owner of the company, me and two others below her and collectively we run the day to day operation. Over time I’ve been consistently excluded from pertinent communication, finding things out because I’m in the office overhearing conversations, and generally treated like a second class colleague. I’ve had conversations bringing it all up but there’s only so much “hey can you include me” proactive attempts I can do without feeling totally demoralized. Also, since it’s a small team they approach things in a “when a problem comes up we will Figure out a solution,” and generally are poor at communication and setting expectations. I literally walk in on convos of things being discussed and have lost track of how many times I have to say “wait, what’s this about?” On top of it my coworker who pitched for me to join has this almost compulsive need to assert that she’s in charge and the “alpha” around there- “correcting” me in front of coworkers/staff, jumping in on me with my clients to offer her own recommendations, dismissing my comments when I talk about preferences, literally dominating conversation in meetings and already knowing or having knowledge of all the things, even taking the casual information I mention about past clients to the boss as her own. I don’t honestly think she realizes how much she does it especially in a work context that doesn’t seem to have boundaries in the upper management portion. She’s seemingly receptive to conversations and have made attempts to rectify my concerns but it never sticks. I’ve offered and implemented proactive solutions but they get thrown out and the other two do their own thing. It’s very much a “big fish in a small pond” syndrome. The kicker is they’re BFF to the point of having been roommates in the past and so I’m thinking my frustrations with communication and steamrolling is with me personally. They def have their own communication and are great about meeting the other’s needs. On top of it, The other colleague seems to be totally fine when the first one talks over her professional opinions. It’s so weird and Co-dependent. I’m to the point of being ready to quit. I’ve only been here a year and when I’ve tried to bring my concerns to my boss she’s pretty much explained and defended why they do what they do. She’s also weird about how she communicates- she talks at whoever is near her and hopes it gets carried across? Like today she walked into the office and looked at the “alpha” wannabe coworker to inform her of something we should all know, directed all the conversation at her only while I was literally sitting at my desk adjacent to her.

297,e6ln8r,Unholimonky,1575571970.0,5,How do I deal with my teenage niece?,"This is going to be a strange circumstance, but it's legit. 

TLDR: How do I parent my niece, when SIL doesn't parent her. 

My wife's sister was living with the father of her youngest daughter, age 3. She has two other daughters from a previous relationship, ages 16 and 18. 3 yr old's father is an alcoholic, and abusive, so she moved out of his place, and moved in with my family. They took over my daughters room, my daughter moved into our room, and I have been switching between the couch and my son's room. It has been about 6 months since they moved in, and my SIL is on the list for low income housing. 

We house is relatively small, about 1200 square ft. Before they moved in, it felt cramped, with 2 kids under 6. My SIL has 50% custody of her 3 yr old, and her 16 yr old lives in another city with a relative, so she can go to her regular school. The 18 yr old sleeps on a mattress on the floor. 

My 18 yr old niece has been acting out, talking back to my wife, talking back to her mother, etc. She never does any of her dishes, or her laundry. She is awake at all hours of the night, watching loud tv until we tell her to turn it down. 

Last night I checked our mail after everyone had gone to sleep, and found that she ordered a ""vibrating massager"". 

I understand that she is 18, and technically an adult, but I just dont feel comfortable with her keeping that kind of thing, seeing as how there are so many young children in the house, and there isnt an area she can really hide it. My wife is uncomfortable with her having it in our daughters room. 

SIL doesn't make her do anything, and let's her talk back. Her 3 yr old daughter is her focus 100% of the time, so 18 yr old gets very little attention.

298,e6lmjl,sherbiss,1575571883.0,3,Meeting up for a post breakup talk today.,"Context..

My partner and I (both 24) were together for 8 months, things started out really intense and wonderful. We are very aligned in our politics and mannerisms and always had great times together. My partner was supportive, kind, honest and very reliable. 

The only issue I had in the relationship was that they would lean heavily on my for emotional support regarding their job, family issues, school, and emotional health.

They would text me daily, very heavy things it felt like they were constantly trying to process with me.. they did make space for me to process when I needed it, but there was definitely an imbalance.

We worked hard to create boundaries and they stopped texting me about their issues/needs for support.. but would still talk about politics/their job/school/mental health constantly when we were together.

It got to the point where I dreaded hanging out because it didn’t feel lighthearted or fun for what I could easily say was months.. 

So the night before thanksgiving they stayed at my place, and we planned to go see their family in the morning. I was up all night with anxiety about not wanting to go and not wanting to be next to my partner in bed and realizing things weren’t going to get better. I couldn’t fake it or take it anymore so I broke up with them thanksgiving morning.

At first I was really sad and going through the motions of being unsure of my decision, but it’s been a week since our breakup and I am feeling so much happier/ lighter and really sure of my decision to breakup.

They texted me a few days ago saying they wanted to talk, and were feeling confused about our last conversation / needed to know where they stand. We planned to meetup today.. but last night they texted me again to clarify time/place and ended their text with “I’m not feeling good about what the outcome of this will be and I’m overwhelmed”.. which to me feels like another plea for emotional support.

So I responded letting them know that I did not want to get back together, and that I was prepared to answer any questions they had / try my best to help them with healing/closure during our meetup.

I’m just really feeling anxious about today.. not looking forward to it at all and could use any insight, validation, suggestions, etc.

299,e6lmhl,riversfromspace,1575571879.0,1,Unequal emotional support...,"Hey friends, 
So I've been seeing this amazing girl for 4 months now & it's been so great until the last few days. I went to stay at her place & we ended up hanging for 3 days straight, which is a little longer than usual. Honestly, this whole story of us getting together is worthy of another post but I'll just ask this for now:

She is a full-time student that also struggles with much anxiety, and my energy seems to really calm her  & keep things light. I can usually summon an almost obnoxious amount of optimism, finding a bright & laughable side to most problems. It's a superpower. 
However, still be very much a human, I have my own emotional struggles: I wake up some days ""dead inside"", negatively neutral, silent, non-expressive... Honestly I don't really understand it, but it's part of me for now. So I woke up next her this morning feeling this way & she didn't know how to deal with me and neither did I. She tried, gave me plenty of practical advice (morning routines, jumping into action...), but I wasn't snapping out of it and things ended up feeling weird & strained.. it didn't help that I had committed to taking her to and from a dental surgery this morning. 
It's just messy me up because when she's in her moods, I'm totally supportive & understanding & gentle and give her all the time she needs because I know for me, enough time passes and I'm back in my natural state. 
It just feels like I have so much to give when she needs support & love, yet I feel slightly abandoned & ashamed when I'm suffering emotionally. Honestly, I'm fine dealing with my problems on my own, as there's little risk of bringing anyone down with me. But now that we're spending so much time, I don't always have that luxury. 
I think I need a gentler, cozier kind of support instead of fiery, logical advice. Or I just need to be strong enough to walk away & take the time away for the mood to pass. 
Now I'm feeling more myself & ready to talk it out but life is too mischievous; I'm in the waiting room now and when she emerges she'll be f*cked on dental drugs & likely unable to communicate.
So we'll see. Wow, not really sure what I'm asking you folks anymore but this was a great vent for me. Any thoughts & questions are most welcome. Enjoy your day & thanks for reading all this!",relationship_advice

I'll try to make it short. I'm dating this guy, we've been seing each other for about a month. It's the very first time i'm dating someone I really like. He kissed me first, invited me to sleep at his friend's apartment with him, talked about me to his friend I met last week. We have very deep conversations. Some might say i'm about to be his girlfriend, but there's something wrong for me...

He's not very intimate with me. I try to touch his hands, his arms, and he does not push me away, but he does not respond. He does not initiate physical contact unless we are all alone. When we are in bed only, he is tender, he touches me, but especially my breasts, never my face. He uses his fingers too, well you know what i mean, but it seems he doesn't want me to touch him back. 

Am I really a turn off for him ?

I was cheated on by my boyfriend of 6 years at the beginning of the year. He started dating the woman he cheated on me with(the mistress knew about me), then cheated on her with me (I didn't know they were together at that time). After that, I was done and dated a nice guy for about 6 months. My ex dated two other women (at the same time) and got caught. 

He started to realize he had a problem and went to a couple counseling sessions. He was never unfaithful before this year, and traumatic events have happened before he cheated on me (his mom commited suicide). 


We have a child together, and started becoming more friendly with each other when picking up/dropping off the child. Eventually, he confessed and seemed genuinely remorseful for cheating on me in the first place, and said he because he resented me for not allowing him to place his mother's ashes in our living room (I know, this is a completely bitchy thing of me and I am in the wrong. My own religious beliefs kept me narrow minded on that, and I realize now how much hurt I have caused him for arguing about where his mom's urn could be). 


I understood the affair. Though the other two women he cheated on were innocent, I understand he was/is in a very dark place. Everything mentioned was completely out of character for him.


I ended up breaking up with the new guy I was dating and got back with my ex. Some days are great and some days are an emotional rollercoaster as the recovery process is so hard.

305,e6ljeb,Chickenstripplatter,1575571521.0,1,I (20 M) have a crush on somebody else but I don’t know if I should break up with my girlfriend (20 F),"This probably sounds stupid because i’m young and new to dating but I met this girl in Highschool. She was the first person to talk to me (the new kid) and she was super cute but very shy and it was a little obvious she was into me. I never asked her out because I was nervous and young and oblivious or whatever. In senior year, freakin three years later, my friends invite another girl (my now girlfriend) into our friend group. We immediately clicked as friends and talked all the time like DAILY. I didn’t have a crush on her but I did value my friendship with her a lot. But also throughout senior year the girl that had been into me at the beginning started making it more obvious and trying to spend more time with me and nudging me in that sort of direction. I had two ladies that I liked at the time

My now gf let’s call her K

And my crush lets call her F

F was cute and shy and into me and I felt butterflies every time i was with her.

K is funny and smart and easiest to talk to.

After my graduation I had a party at my friends house where I got extremely drunk. I posted all over social media that I’d been drinking. The same five minutes my crush texts me that shes been drinking too and that she had a huge crush on me and that she thinks I’m super cute. We both crashed at some point but I remember also telling her that I ‘loved’ her, which def did not seem to turn her off.
The next morning we gathered ourselves and texted eachother how we ‘really’ felt to which I said “I do still like you” and she then finally asked me out. We went on a date and it was fun albeit awkward and hungover. I definitely still liked her.

I dropped her off at her house and that was that.

A week later and she asks me out again but I say no for whatever reason I cannot remember. And she doesn’t ask again. I feel like an idiot for not talking to her after a month and things between us start to fizzle. I still have regular group hangouts with my friends and K starts to do the same thing F did. Make it more noticeable and try to nudge me in that direction.

She eventually asks me out. I officially have no balls because that’s two girls who have asked ME out. Although I didn’t like her as much as F she was a LOT more fun and a lot easier to flirt with. We go on a date like everyday and within a month we make it official.
Cut to a six months later I am living my best life. She is funny, smart, cute, and I love her. K is my world and I would die for her.
And then... I got a new job. I started work at a big retail company. The same exact building that F works at. I did know she worked there. But I honestly did not think I would get that job.

Now my K HATES F. She knows about our date, she knows everything about F and she despises her. She thinks shes creepy and stalkerish. I don’t really know why but I have to convince her that I don’t like her either or I won’t ever hear the end of it.

So I’ve only exchanged a few words with F and she seems nice still, she doesn’t seem upset an me and K. (She seemed a little sarcastic over Facebook when we made it official) she looks even cuter then before and she seems more talkative and less shy. I haven’t had a full length conversation with her but. I think I still like her. Another six months later and i have F’s snapchat and we talk a lot. I’ve started to develop a crush on her again but idk things with my girlfriend are weird and I feel stuck.

K and I talk about getting married and having kids even though at the beginning I said I definitely do not want kids. I can’t seem to convince her that I still don’t. She quit her job and moved into my house... I’ve somehow convinced her that we will be together forever and that I’ll take care of her but I don’t remember saying I’d do EVERYTHING. She has a mental episode/breakdown everyday. Every day. She hates my new work schedule and gets mad everytime I come home late and won’t let me sleep. She’s so clingy, my only second of free time is my evening escape to sit on the toilet for a half an hour. She doesn’t like to spend time with my family or her family. She finds excuses to not spend time with our friends... and of course I feel bad if I go by myself. And her stress and social anxiety prevents her from doing anything physical. So she sits in bed all day and doesn’t do anything but watch YouTube or Netflix. Maybe once a week she looks for a job but then she cries because she can’t get to those places because did I mention she doesn’t have a driver’s license? She cries every time she gets behind a wheel.

The worst part is that she is completely emotionally dependent on me. In her own words. She is sadder when I am not around. Am I the BIGGEST ASSHOLE in the WORLD if I broke up with her?

There are a lot of things she does that makes up for it though. She’s cute and easy to talk to. She tries to cheer me up when I’m sad. She’ll tru to cover her own bill with whatever little money she still has. Etc. there are still things I love about her. But when I put them into words like I did just now I feel like I’m overly glorifying them in my head.

How do I do this...? I feel like I know what to do but what if F doesn’t feel the same anymore and K is miserable and then I end up miserable...? I’m stuck.",relationship_advice

&#x200B;

Me (M22) and ex-gf (F24) broke up in the end of September this year. We dated for a year and hadn't any spectacular problems. The reason behind the break up was just that se wanted more space and really didn't love herself. She wanted to be more independent and be happy for herself. For the begin, I couldn't accept that and I thought there was something I did wrong and we could just get it better by communicating. I blame myself. But now that's cool for me.

We started with a ""break"" which was 1 or 2 week long. After that I felt so bad that I wanted to end. This is my first real relationship and I have been quite sad since the break up. I work out 5-7 per week, have a lot to work to do at the university. But still she is the first thing  I will think in the morning and and last thing when I go to bed.

Like I said, there isn't anything where I would feel good despite the training. There my focus is 100% on that. But even there I won't feel as happy as before things were good.

And now for the last weekend. We go to the same university and we have same parties. I went out with my friends and wasn't looking for anything. I saw a girl that I knew from school. I didn't do any flirting with her expect if dancing is one of it? By the end of the night, she wanted to go and I left with her because I thought there wasn't anything what I would miss at the club. We walked to same direction and when I lowkey wanted to go to my place alone, she pulled my arm to her street and I didn't refuse. We got to her apartment and I was wondering in my head should I leave or stay. I really didn't know what to do. I could see that she wanted me but I said to her that I wouldn't want to do anything, just sleep. Then she put her pajamas and I decided to stay. We slept in a kind of spoon. But nothing happened. In the night I was sweating and I couldn't get much sleep. In the morning I woke and left.

I have though of the reason I wanted to stay and the only reason I could get is that I missed the intimacy I got from my ex. And after the night I realised I couldn't get it anywhere else.

I didn't and don't want to hurt my now ex-girlfriend in any way. I know my self-esteem is as low as it possible can. I am in shape and I know I could pick up almost any girl I wanted if I tried. But my head is just so f\*cked up. And I don't want to do stupid things and embarrass myself even more. And most of the people from our school think I have this amazing life although I have felt depressed and sh\*t the past couple of months.

One really interesting point of this story is that one male friend of her (let's call her A) saw me in the bar and talking to this girl.  So he snitched me to her. After the night out my ex-gf messaged me and asked how was the night. I though she meant the pre-party and I told what we did there (trivia and eating etc). But then she said that A saw me in the bar and talking to this girl. And I replied that I was there and I talked to her. Then my ex-gf asked if I left with this girl from the bar. I first replied why that would consider her now that we aren't together and she got upset to me. She said that she is a women so of course she is interested. And I have spoke to her and ask things so why wouldn't she ask me. And then she started accusing me that if I myself considered a poor communication as a problem in our relationship, why would I question her as soon as she asked me what have I done. (So she tried to guilt-trip me here(?))

We have been talking couple times after the break up and even seeing each other. I have just wanted to talk things through because I believed there was just too many ""what if"". I forgot to mention I saw my ex couple days before and I asked her could she see a future with me. She said that she doesn't see now but could see in the future when she get's better. Although this hurt me a lot I finally got a feeling there isn't anything I could do and the best thing for us is that we both move along.

We talked a lot from this and that for the evening. It felt like she enjoyed talking with me. For couple times I could see that her replies prolong. But the day after I felt so bad guilty so I had to admin her that I had been in this girl's place. I said we didn't do any kissing or nothing else. I said I have been so lost in my mind so I don't really know what to do with anything. And I still feel guilty. She was little bit upset but she kind of knew something like this happened. This has felt for me like I cheated her. And I have zero tolerance with cheating in any way. But I wouldn't have done this if we would be together. But now I feel shitty.

I love my ex still and my next mission is to get my mind straight and live my life for myself. For next year, I will start to play guitar as well other hobbies.

Bottom line is that am I a bad person? Should I feel guilty? I try to be the best version of myself but it's really hard some times. I want to punish myself for this. Am I a cheater? Why would I do this to myself and for my ex.

&#x200B;

TLDR: We broke up couple months ago. I have felt sad since that and don't really know why I went to other girl's home after club night. I slept beside a girl and feel guilty for that. Other guy snitched me to my ex-gf and I admitted to her because I couldn't live with my conscience.

&#x200B;

P.S This male friend of her is one story itself. He has been trying to get my ex as long as we have been dating. First my ex just used himto get answers for school projects but then she friendzoned him so they really are friends now. This guy has tried multiple girls but has ended up with a friend lol. For example, my ex searched a dress for a specific party and it took him only 15 minutes to find 6 different options. Like what!? She told me that and said that I would do the same I would be her friend also. So I don't really see he as a threat.",relationship_advice

Thanks in advance for all help. So I am a very introverted person. I stay to myself, don't talk much to people at work because I prefer to do something on my phone or focus on the task I'm doing. Either that or I'm in my head just thinking. I have been doing this job for like 6 months or so now. I got a new coworker and she asks a lot of questions on things she should already know. I like to help people out but sometimes with her it feels like helping someone that is really slow to learn so it can be exhausting for me. I ask her why she doesn't just write things down or look at the procedure book, but she says she prefers to ask a lot of questions because that's how she takes in the information better and helps her learn the routine. This could work with someone else but it bothers me to have to answer these questions all the time, yet I try not to be rude and just help her. I don't know how to respectfully tell her to look at the procedures and try to handle the problem on her own and to make sure before she asks something that she really doesn't know it, because that's what I do. It's really starting to stress me out and my solution so far has been to tell her that I am not in a good mood and don't really want to talk and I'd enjoy some quiet. But then she also brings up little small talk things to talk about and I just really don't care that much because I want to be alone. This is an office setting btw, not a fast-paced job.

I know I sound like an asshole. I really want to find a peaceful and respectful way of telling her how I feel and letting her solve things by herself (Obviously things she should already know, I don't mind answering things that she obviously was never taught or doesn't know). Or if there's anything I can do or a better mindset that I can adopt to be more okay and helpful with her questions. She has been working here for roughly 2 months now.

Im not gonna go into specifics but two months ago we started talking, some bad things happened and i hit a low point in life and her being there for me made me fall for her. We talked more and I realized i liked her. So skip to today i asked her out and she said this: 
“No. Well i do want to. But i cant. I am not a person who likes to be held under a title. Ill love and be loyal to you. But not under a title. Its too much of a commitment and i like the way things are. Im sorry if this hurts you but i dont want to say yes and then be unhappy and eventually start hating you for it. “

I was a little confused so i asked her to clarify. Basically she loves me but feels like her being my girlfriend is a title and that she just wanted to stay as friends. Im not mad about the rejection because i’ve been rejected before and took it well, i’m mad that she didn’t tell me about this earlier and she didn’t discuss how she felt. I don’t know how to feel anymore to be honest, i’m mad at her but i feel like an ass for being mad at her. I just don’t know what to do, any advice would help",relationship_advice
312,e6lgrn,stopfeeding_yourdog,1575571215.0,2,How to deal with shitty coworker,"Hi, so I work in the medical field. I’ve got a coworker who we will call Sally. Now, sally is basically my age (a year younger) she’s worked here for about 2-1/2 years and I’ve worked here 1-1/2. 

Sally is very particular and OCD. Her and I work together and are at the same level/ position but have some different tasks. 


We have a checklist of cleaning we do every day, that has to be done between 12-2:00

I go to lunch from 12:00-1:00 and on days I work with another coworker, we split it 50/50 and I do the rest when I get back because I have the earliest lunch. 


Almost 3 months into this job me and sally have had conflict after conflict after conflict. She will follow around and watch everything I do, complain before I do it and after take pictures, extra weird stuff. It got so bad our person who supervises our position specifically complained about it that Sally was being ridiculous. We’ve had meeting after meeting after meeting. Nothing changes and it only seems to get worse. 

She’s short with me, rude to me, and leaves a lot of the stuff for me to do usually and just sits on her phone and acts like I don’t exist. I’ve tried to patch things up with her and start actual conversations like “Is there a reason you’re acting like this, I don’t want to be your enemy, if I’ve done something to you please tell me” etc. it’s only seemed to get worse and my frustration is starting to become anger.


In contrast she’s literally best friends with our other coworkers at our level who I get along with well too. We are also friends with our fourth coworker, I’ve never had these problems with anyone else here. 


Today as I was leaving for lunch I did 1 item on the list. I went to help someone with another task and while that was happening she re did it, erased my name on the list and did not say a single word to me. 

She has be reprimanded and *threatened* a write up about this countless times before.  Our main manager is honestly getting fed up with all of this, but we are a family orientated business so she is not willing to let anyone go.


I asked sally before leaving why she did that, people saw me complete the task, and I had my name on it. She snapped back at me and said “it didn’t look like it got done” (it clearly was..)



I’ve tried being friends, I’ve tried being nice, i’m not willing to stoop to her petty level and risk my job. I’m also fearing the tension that is caused from problems like these repeatedly being brought up to our frustrated supervisor. Because i’m always the one to bring it up. I’m not willing to be a silent victim in this but it feels like two little children telling on each other. 


Any advice appreciated.

When she told me she fell in love with two person at once, she told me she is choosing him not me, while i was crying on her knees, i watched her leave my house that day, after these things i lost my nails in a depression state, at least thats what doctor told me that that is all beach of stress, and i was not doing anything to my figers, i was a long haired guy, i cut my hair like till the half of it, and all the other stuff, she left me for other guy and also they broke up 1-2 months later, that sound a little happy eh ? Guess what, she met with another guy 2 months later and got married with him, and i always told myself she did NOT deserved it.

Back to my life, i dated 4 girls after that relationship and i never felt anything, it was always the same endless cycle. First day, i love the girl and we are cool, a nice couple i would say,the second day, im bored, not feeling anything, the relationship feels unimportant, lost my interest, and no, no sex involved in these losing interest stuff, not any sudden hormone changes either. I have broken some hearts in that time 4 of the girls loved me and i treated them like shit after the second day, and i always felt sorry,  i was both sorry and mad, but mostly, furious. After her i never loved anybody, and i can’t even if i try, i was afraid to try i did not wanted to use anybody for these “tryings”


I can’t love,and worse, i can’t feel. And now the most important and the part which im asking an advice on.

I am in a long distance relationship with a girl who waited me for a long time, it was fun in first days, more then 2 days at least, and its our 3rd months in our relationship and another 3 months just talking.... our relationship got damaged many times, sometimes my sometimes her fault but the thing is, i really like another girl in my course, she is so pretty i only know her name and thats it no info no talking at all. Sometimes i tell myself, maybe i can feel again with her, and sometimes i think about that same thing may happen, the endless cycle.

I am thinking of finishing this long distance and damaged relationship, and trying with that new girl,

You may say you are a bad person for thinking of this, let me tell you this, i have been dumped by the only one whom i have ever fallen in love with, and she is married, no karma or anything like that,i am the one damaged i am the one who can’t feel now i also think i will be punished by god for dumping my current GF, thats a cycle too.. 

“ can’t so anything, because i think i will be punished, i am mad and furious because my ex is still happy and not punished” its like im in a minefield and can’t move

314,e6lfbe,giblber,1575571048.0,1,My ex (19F) accused me (21M) of abuse over Me Too,"A couple days ago she posted a huge thing on social media saying how her ex (that's me) had abused her all throughout our relationship a year and a half ago. She said she hadn't figured out until now that it was all abuse from me, and no love at all. I can tell you most of what she said are lies, although our relationship wasn't perfect, of course. I accept I had jealousy issues from which I have learned now, but she also had a lot of insecurities and lack of communication that made my inscurities trigger (of course it's not acceptable anyway, but is comes from there). She didn't accept any responsibility, claiming to be the victim, and she invented a lot of bullshit like that I pressured her to have sex (she was 17 back then), which obviously didn't happen. I had just been concerned because in the last few months she didn't show any physical affection. 

I'm over all that since a year ago, but it still conflicts me that someone I loved can say there was no love at all. Since there's all the Me Too thing, obviously everyone believed her and some friends have stopped talking to me (I've been testing them by sending them a text and they just ignore me). She didn't mention my name but they know.

My girlfriend now showed me the post (my ex blocked me, obviously) because a friend of hers showed her to warn her of me. She says I'm not the person in the post and that she just bases herself on what she lives with me. I told her all the story honestly, including my flaws. She's a lot into feminism and Me Too, so I'm not sure she believed me 100% or some part of her still wants to believe the victim. She didn't give much attention to my version of the story, but still, we didn't talk much about it and moved forward. 

I'm not in a real dilemma here, I'm just a little down over losing friends and that I can't really share that with my girlfriend because neither her nor me want to drag that into our relationship. 

Any words are helpful, thanks.",relationship_advice
315,e6lfa9,Merh-h,1575571045.0,0,Fixing my girlfriend before I breakup with her? HELP PLEASE READ,"Fixing my girlfriend before I break up with her... HELP PLEASE READ (we are both 25)

I’m sorry I know this is long but please read

Well I know that this is going to sound weird but here’s the story. My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years. I love her to DEATH. She’s funny, smart, has a wonderful job and anyone would be lucky to be with her. 

When we first started dating I knew that she was a bit socially awkward, I understand.. I am too a little but I have a good group of friends and can handle myself around new ppl AND I enjoy meeting new ppl. thought that she’d grow out of it. We moved from California to Chicago because she got a really good job and I was so excited! A completely new city! At this point I didn’t really realize that we became codependent. I moved away from all of my friends to be with her because I love her so much. Neither of us made or tried to make any friends. It was pretty normal for her but not for me. I felt so bad leaving her at home so I could try to make some sort of social life but I eventually gave up all together. 

We have been in Chicago for about 2 1/2 years and we have seen and done just about everything twice over. There’s places that I love to go to but I just want to enjoy them with someone else other than just her but again, I feel bad about trying to make friends and leaving her at home. The thing is, she doesn’t actually enjoy being alone, she likes going out and she wants to make friends but when it comes to ppl other than me, she’s so awkward!! Most ppl find her extremely weird and don’t want to hangout with her. On the small chance that I do meet someone while we are out and about, the friendship that I could’ve had is instantly ruined by something she says. It’s always on accident but it’s so embarrassing.

I’m not blaming her for me not having a social life, it is 100% my fault for not wanting her to feel bad. She tells me that I can go out by myself or hangout with some of my work friends without her but she says it in this sad voice so I always end up not doing anything without her. It’s probably me... Maybe I’m reading her wrong and she really doesn’t care! But I wish she had a set of friends herself so that when I’m out, she’s out and not sitting at home, which she HATES doing! 

On top of this, she has let herself go. *BTW I HAVE NEVER SHAMED HER FOR ANYTHING! I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO A WOMAN EVER*.. She has gained noticeable weight and of course I have not and will not say anything to her about it. I try to encourage her by making healthy dinners and asking her to go to the gym with me. She refuses to workout with me so I don’t know what to do about that. There’s no way in Hell that I’ll say anything to her about her weight but I’ve noticed that I’m just not physically sexually attracted to her anymore. 

I love her so so so much but I haven’t touched her in months. I daydream about other women and being single constantly, but when I see Her it reminds me how much I love her and I just want to help her. I want to help her socially and physically I don’t know I don’t want to leave her but I do at the same time. 

I’m trying to decide what I should do. Stay because I love her or leave. I’ve had this crazy thought in my head that I should help her before I break her heart so that it’s easier for her to bounce back. It kills me to think if I leave her, she’ll be alone.. I SOUND SO CRAZY. IVE ONLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, NEVER TYPED IT I SOUND INSANE!! But this is really what I’m thinking! Encourage her to lose weight with me, stop her constant wine drinking (it’s really bad, she drinks a whole bottle of white wine EVERY-NIGHT), and maybe encourage her to talk to ppl more. 

Please tell me the truth. I really do love her, I just don’t know if I can take it anymore.",relationship_advice

This was mainly due to my Gran having married a rich but abusive man and my parents wanting to keep me away from him but also due to a lot of lies and drama that side of the family made up. I have grown up telling people all my life that I didn't have grandparents or cousins. I haven't received so much as a birthday card in all those years but had that side of the family defame me and spread malicious rumours (Including a lie that 7 year old me told my gran she was dead to me). Since then, one of my cousins has had two children and gotten married and we were not invited to the wedding or christening.

  
At Christmas last year my step Granddad died and the family slowly got back in touch, but most importantly my Gran. (Now before I continue please don't be under any illusion that my Gran was only distant due to her horrible husband, I have been assured by both parents that she was awful before that point. She pinched me awake when i was born because she was mad I was asleep when she visited, asked my dad not to marry my mum and then wore black to their wedding and would sleep with married men until they left their wives then dropped them). My Gran has been calling me regularly being very kind, funny, compassionate and really trying to get to know me, and I have been struggling to come to terms with this relationship due to not speaking to her in 15 and the fact that my mum (who is my best friend) hates her. It has been clear in these 15 years that my cousins and aunt have been using their relationship with her for profit, over the years they have been given tens of thousands of pounds each including £10,000 or a car on their 21st birthday. They have recently cut contact after gran told them she cold no longer afford to give them this kind of money due to her husband dying. We have been there to support her since, asking nothing in return. I have always just wanted a family due to being an only child. For my recent birthday she gave me a card, not addressed to me (it was blank bar her signature), but I was grateful to receive it all the same. For Christmas, she has announced that she will only be giving money to her great grandkids as she feels she's ""spent enough on the rest of us"". Now the crux is, I don't want her money. I would just like a small present such as a scarf or a box of chocolate as a sort of goodwill gesture to make up for the lost years. Dad is suggesting we cut contact if she continues to give my cousins and aunts money yet gives us nothing. Is this relationship worth continuing and am I being spoilt for wanting something for Christmas? Should I just be thankful my Gran is back in my life?",relationship_advice

318,e6le5a,ImNoThro,1575570917.0,0,"Not enough sex, but wife thinks there is such a thing as too much?","I'll give a little background first.  My wife and I have been together about 10 years.  Married for about 5.  One child.  We have a few issues in our relationship but the biggest and primary one for me has been physical intimacy.  It's been a consistent problem throughout our relationship, and to be completely fair I should have ended it a long time ago before a mortgage and my kid became involved.

We've been in marriage counseling for about 6 months.  She has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety, and we have made some progress.  

Over the past week we've been having sex almost daily, and we had a conversation about it last night that put me off a bit.  I told her that I was happy with the past week, that the kind of intimacy we had is what I've wanted and needed.  She started talking about menopause, and about her libido, and generally hinting that she has no intention of allowing this to go on.  She sort of suggested that it was too much.

Which is difficult for me.  My general read of things is that people show up in the marriage counselor's office complaining that they don't have sex often enough.  I feel like I don't hear about people showing up saying that they have sex too often.  That just doesn't seem to be a specific complaint I hear.

The other thing I keep pointing out to her is this; she keeps asking me if I need it daily, and telling me that she can't do that.  Which frankly upsets me.  I think we've cleared up that there will be days when one or the other of us isn't feeling well or has some issue and I completely and totally accept that, but the point I keep making to her is that this is something which can take as little as 5 to 10 minutes a day, and the person who promised to spend the rest of his life with you is asking for 5 to 10 minutes a day to save our marriage, and this is the place where you're trying to tell me I'm asking too much of you?  

I guess I'm just looking for perspectives on that.  I read advice on here fairly often that makes me feel like I'm coercing her into something, but honestly it either needs to work out or we do immense damage to all of our lives.  I'm not going to allow my needs to continue to not be met by our relationship.  I tried to be okay with it for a long time, and it ate me up and did lots of damage to our relationship.

319,e6ldlf,Thrpwawayjweknekw,1575570851.0,0,Reddit is making me distrust all women,"I (16M) have seen too many stories on reddit's relationship subs and other subs of women cheating at their bachelorette parties, hiding their past and lying. It's mostly the cheating stuff.

I just distrust all women because of these cheating stories. I know guys cheat too but it seems a lot less imho.

Now whenever I have sex with a girl or something, I immediately leave after orgamsing because I don't trust them enough to stay the night (slept with 2 girls from school).

I think I'm becoming cynical because I see so many people defend cheating women. I've seen these types in my family too.

**However, the main thread is the AMA with male stripper. There are several of these and they confirm my fears. That women cheat when they get the chance and its widespread phenomena that is taboo but very real.**

But I'm confused and starting to get drained.,"tl;dr Girlfriend has clinical depression and recently things have been different. She is overall less engaged/mental present and I am not getting my emotional/physical needs met. I dont know if its because she has lost interest in me or if she has just been really down recently. I dont know what to do to.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now and I really do love her, but she comes with a lot of emotional baggage.

She suffers from clinical depression and I've known this from basically the start of the relationship. This was and is not a deal breaker for me. She is a fighter and I have never seen her go into a full on ""lay in bed all day, do nothing, talk to no one"" depressive state. She gets up every day rain or shine and preforms when she needs to, works harder than anyone, goes out and has fun, ect. Those who dont know her well wouldn't guess she has clinical depression. But recently I have been seeing her depressed side more and more.

When we first started dating I wouldn't have guess she was depressed either. For the first 4-5 months she would really only have a few (2-3) ""down"" days a month. On those days she would get insecure and sad and after work she would just want to lay down, watch tv, vent a little about what was up, and wasn't her normal chatty self. I saw what everyone else say and I was more than happy lay around and listen to her vent about whats bothering her.

After that things changed a bit. She began having more ""down"" days but I was the only one who knew what was going on. She would still go out/talk with her friends and me/work/hobbies/ect, but I would get a lot more venting than before. I was fine with this and it made sense that we have been dating for a while and she. But after the venting was over she was always ready to interact and genuinely seemed engaged/happy to see me. Even though I experienced more of her sad side than anyone things where good.

Recently though (I'd say over the past 2-3 months) things have been different and I'm not sure what to make of it. When we are together now she just seems less engaged and just less chatty than before. She is engaged/""on""/excited/cheerful when we first start hanging out and then kinda ""turns off"" when we are together ( I know thats not a great description but its the best I can think of ). She just seems more engaged with everyone else throughout her day (peers, friends, colleagues, ect) than she does with me. I brought this up to her a while back and her reasoning for it was because she feels she has to be ""on"" a lot of the time and when she is around me she says she feels she can just be ""off"".

I have two concerns about this:

First of all is this really the case? None of her friends see this side of her and she is always ""on"" with them. In fact the only person she is ever ""off"" around is me. My more insecure side wonders from time to time if she has lost interest in me/ is interested in someone else. I do a lot for her; take her out to eat, drive her around, let her sleep over because her place/roommates aren't great, provide a lot of emotional support, and I feel like I could be being used.

Second is her being ""off"" is starting to drain me. I love talking/interacting with her and I am kinda hurt/upset when she is not engaged most of the time. She claims shes feeling better/happier than she has in a long time but I just feel this isnt the case. I'm her main emotional outlet and in a sense I feel I have become a therapist and I feel she needs to seek more help than I can provide. She also doesn't want to have sex anywhere near as much as she did when we first started. Now most nights we hang out she just wants to watch tv and go to bed early. I catch her staring off more and more when I'm talking or giving the typical not really listening to what I'm saying answers. I feel our conversation has devolved to how are day was, whats upsetting her, and things we are going to do. We dont have deep/interesting/provocative/ect conversations like we used to. Basically I feel like I'm not having my emotional/physical needs met to the degree I meet hers.

322,e6lb8b,anirbas321,1575570572.0,1,Inexperienced and Drowning,"This is long. I’m sorry. I’m horribly sick. 

I (31f) do not have a prolific romantic history is the least. I have had only four relationships previous to this one and my current one is the longest by 1.5 months for making it to 7.5 months. 

And I recognize I’m the common denominator. I’m always the breakee and I unfortunately have just been collecting issues and traumas — I am not flying blind though and all of it; I am weekly or biweekly going to therapy. 

I’ve been suffering from some bad depressive lows and I have a habit of sacrificing everything to make other people happy. My expectations of myself are impossibly high whereas any one else would just have to give me like a ketchup packet and that they thought enough of me to do so much is pleasing. I just hate myself so completely and my lack of career success makes me feel like a 15 year old. 

I’ve also done a really poor job at maintaining most of my relationships friends and family — it’s to the point I could say nothing for weeks and maybe months before anyone questions that something might me wrong. So... I’ve become quite lonely all the time. 

My current SO (34m) isn’t entirely unknowledgeable about my struggles. I break down on rare occasions and whine at him. It’s hard when I feel bad all the time — I don’t want to be The Downer all the time. I’ve read a lot of posts about guys with depressive girlfriends and when they are wondering if it’s ok to leave because it’s too much. 

During these rare breakdowns he does the right and good thing anyone would do to and tries to console me. He tells me I’m the only one who thinks those things of myself and (twice now) that I’m the most important thing in existence to him and that he cares a lot. 

And that’s great. And it would probably mean something more to read... if I ever got any idea he felt like that when I wasn’t in rare form and then guilty for being in that form for a week. 

I’m perhaps guilty of being very attention seeking and I hate it. He never asks how I’m doing and he’s very much the type who can get by on 1-3 sentences a day. I’m... less so. I’ve stopped asking about his day and cut way back on silly inane conversation when he told me he felt bad for not having anything red letter to say and that it made him feel like a dick and lazy for nothing having anything to respond with respectively. (Which In a way was better because getting “lol” all the time as the only reaction is very disheartening.) we have also only spoken on the phone about 4 times since he doesn’t really like talking on the phone. 

And I’m not saying he should message me at work. But despite nothing having jobs that more or less end or are done before 5-6pm and live about 15 minutes away— we don’t hang out often. And I stopped asking now and wait for him because he’s tired after work and sleeps when he gets home. My job starts earlier than his so while he can wake up at 10pm and game for a bit — I often have to be up by 4 or 5am so I shouldn’t be. So there isn’t a lot of overlap. 

I’m guilty of assuming these changes in my taking are what he wanted and would make things better based on one throwaway comment. I just... I can be better so I should. And i know if I want to talk about something or I’m having a problem I should open my mouth and say it. I’m a Fucking adult and able-bodied enough to open my mouth and make sound. And I don’t and he isn’t a mind reader. 

Except that he’s told me that I’m a terrible liar and that at best I can put on a “happy shell.” And that he recognizes that I’m getting distant or having trouble with something but doesn’t want to bother me if I don’t want to talk about it so he doesn’t ask. 

And it makes me feel really invisible. I spend a lot of time taking care of other people and for so long have lied that I’m doing better than i am because realistically I’ve got a roof over my head and access to food and the privilege to even post something here. How bad can things be. Except they are. That’s so unbearably selfish and needy. 

I don’t envy dating someone so mentally incapable — it’s got to be more daunting and more work and I don’t know that the pay off is worth it if it ever comes. 

I’ve tried to talk to him. I’ve written him letters when my attempts to lay everything out ended up with getting out precisely 2% of what I wanted to say before clamming up because I’m a fucking idiot. I’ve been writing them for months. And I keep coming up with reasons to not send it. “Oh, I should wait after X event so I don’t ruin anything.” But there was always another event. 

I think he parents like me well enough and I know the validation of having and SO can be great. But he doesn’t seem really interested in me or passionate about me. It feels self serving to say I’m trying to involve myself in his likes like he isn’t — maybe he is and I don’t know about it. 

I’m also mildly and irrationally hurt from something of my own making. I sort of made a fool out of myself several months ago a week before my birthday in front of him and his friends. And I was going to leave this party early to regroup and not cause more embarrassment — and again, he did the nice guy thing and had to fucking chase after me and talk to me for an hour outside of my car (who does this to someone? He should have broken up with me then.) I was so embarrassed by myself I didn’t tell anyone about my birthday and let it pass silently. At the time I felt better for it but irrationally because he’s not been curious about my birthday kinda sucks if I’m honest. and I am utterly aware of how unfair and cruel that is. 

It would be different if we did... anything. Largely we sit on his couch and watch YouTube or he plays video games (I don’t mind either) but it’s all we do. I try to take him out on dates when I can but we never do anything... dating/couple like and maybe that makes me a teenager. We go to the occasional concert but otherwise it’s going to go pickup food when the delivery price is too insulting. I don’t need fancy anything. It could be a walk or a game or two of bowling maybe twice a month — once if that’s too much. 

Because I feel like I don’t do much I feel double that I should at least pay half for all the food or occasional thing we do despite being strapped a lot of the time. He makes a lot more money than me but I don’t want him to end up resenting me if I’m always the difficult sad sack on top of having to cover for me all the time. 


I guess. In the end, I feel like a part-time girlfriend whenever it’s good for him. And it doesn’t feel like it’s evolved deeper because of both of our reluctance to talk. 

I just don’t know what to do. I want to send him a letter because I am honestly that pathetic. But I don’t want to ruin his day or make him feel like he’s being attacked. These are all things of my making. 

I know I’m being stupid. I’m sorry. I’m just really bummed out and my head hurts so bad right now haha thought if I just mindlessly wrote this out it’d distract from it for a short while.

There’s this girl I like and she’s also shown  inclination of interest by telling me I’m good looking and have a great sense of humour. She also thinks I’ve must have slept with LOTS of women and must be seeing other women.

I don’t know why she thinks like that. I have her on Instagram after she added me but I’ve never slipped into her DM’s. 

I’ll admit I do have bare chest pics and I’m proud of my body. I use to be really slim and I’ve worked hard at the gym. I told a female friend of mine of what the girl said. My friend told me I’m a good looking guy and look a lot healthier than I did 5 yrs ago. I use to smoke weed and drink a lot.

I use skin moisturisers and I get an expensive haircut every 3 weeks, but this doesn’t make me vain, I’m just in a better place mentally and financially which is ironic as I’m battling cancer but beating it and it’s all gone. Cancer was the reason why I turned my life around.

We grew really close but since we've both changed. Ever since I left for college I noticed a difference in who we are now versus who we used to be. We still talk a lot but she's been stuck in this relationship forever and won't take some of the advice I give her or do anything about it. Our personality differences are just very noticeable now. I love her but she blew up on me over the summer saying I hung out with one of our other friends more than I did her although I'm usually first to initiate hanging out. 

She calls me quite often (which is sweet) but I'm often in class and when we do talk it's about the same problems over again. I've told her I'm always there to support but when we hang out it's just different. I don't want to cut her off or purposefully grow apart because I'm her closest friend, but I just don't know what to do...

327,e6l878,navelbabel,1575570233.0,2,Dealing with friendship guilt,"Hi all, 

Need some quick advice on adult friendships. My best friend (29F) and I have been close for like 15 years. We live in the same city and each have our own other friends but besides her boyfriend I am usually her sort of ‘go-to’ for social activity. She usually wants to spend time together on special occasions (birthday, holidays, long weekends etc). Which is often fine And I love seeing her too but also can make for hectic times when I’m trying to fit everyone in.

Sometimes I butt up against a situation where I’m getting a group together for something, say, a weekend trip, and my husband and I want to invite other people. When it’s one ‘group’ — say like several couple friends who are all close — it’s obvious why it’s those people. 

But it gets awkward in situations like this one now, where two couples have invited us to a weekend trip in a couple months. We have room for one other couple and I know she would want me to invite her and her boyfriend. She has said she wants to do a couples trip so many times over the past few months. But not only do I not think she’d get along that well with them, but my husband wants to invite a couple he knows better since the other two couples are primarily my friends and their partners.

I don’t think it’s rational for me to feel so responsible for looking out for her feelings, but at the same time I know that it’s hard when you feel left out. How do I stop feeling so guilty every time I don’t include her? And what do I say if she confronts me about why I didn’t? 

Frankly I’ve been in the habit of fudging the truth (“so and so planned it and I was  just along for the ride!”) but I don’t know that that’s a good basis for a friendship. How do you communicate “sometimes I just want to hang out with other people instead” without sounding like a jerk?",relationship_advice

At the time I thought she meant the ‘stay away from my man’ type controlling. But she’s been so nuts the entire time I’ve been dating her. She’s been sending serious mixed signals, playing quite a lot of mind games and everything has to be on her terms. 

Starting to wonder what she meant by controlling. There’s more odd stuff too but this really stands out to me. I would talk to her about it but honestly, I feel a bit nervous to. She gets a bit aggressive and passive aggressive if I do. I really really like her but I’m starting to wonder if I’m being manipulated. Even with all the great sex and intimacy.

Starring me 30F he 40m she 35f

Hello, yes IATA, fine fine. I'm stupid and naive and hate myself.

I have been separated from my 6 yr emotionally starving sexually unsatisfied relationship when one of my best friends visited me with her fiancee.
She asked for him to stay for the night  on my couch because he had business in town the next morning and they live 3 hours away.

Sure thing no problem. We had a really nice evening with some alcohol but not too much. She enjoyed it and wanted to stay the night but did not have her medicine with her so she needed to drive home. Her fiance and I had another drink and I immediately went to bed. He slept on the couch.

 After a few minutes I got a text message asking if I was still awake and that he was thinking of kissing me. We never hooked up in the past and I did not know he was interested in me at all. 
First thing I did was asking him does your fiance know about this. He said yes they have a deal that they could hook up with other people. He asked me to join him in the kitchen to talk about this so we did and I kept asking him do you really have this deal? Are you lying to me? He insisted they agreed on being free in that regard. 

He told me  they have threesomes  on the regular  and if she was able to be here she would have  joined us . So I told him we should call her and ask her about it then. 

He said no she is still driving she's tired let's not disturb her we have this deal.

 Since I was sexually starved my hormones got the best of me after like 2 hours of discussion. So we fucked. Several times. We agreed on telling her and asking her if she wants to join in the future. The next day we said goodbye. 

After a couple of days I asked him if he already told her he said no. He said she was not in a good State of Mind. He said she was stressed with her job. He said she would not make it mentally if he told her right now. It would kill her. He said it was fine because I'm a friend and it's much better compared to just picking someone up because he trusts me yada yada. You realize how fucking stupid I am. 

A few days after I texted him again asking him did you tell her he called me and told me we should not tell her at all. He also gave me his work phone number and told me to only text him there because it is secured. When I told him that I enjoyed our texts from the night and kept reading them he reveals that he already deleted them. 

Well enough red flags I realized then that he cheated on her with me and that he's not going to tell her. 

I've known her 4 almost 10 years. I'm fucking stupid naive inconsiderate. This has happened maybe a month ago and I'm struggling with myself and different points of view about whether or not I should tell her. 

Some say that telling people something like that is only to relieve my own conscience and that he would not help her in any ways. Others state that I would forever feel guilty if 10 years down the line she found him cheating on her with someone else and telling me if I only knew earlier. 

I would be forever thankful for advice you can give me. Do I tell her? How do I tell her? Face2face? I'm going to be in their town in 2 weeks and I've asked her if she has time for dinner. I also told him that I would be there just in case he wouldn't be suspicious if she told him she's going for dinner with me. I don't think he suspects anything. She doesn't suspect anything. All my doors are still open. 

Best case she says yeah we have that deal you're a shit friend get lost. I don't care if the friendship is ruined when I tell her, I have fucked it up already anyways.

I wrote a book, so apologies for that. If you have time, I could really really use some input here.  

Tl;dr : My mother is constantly demeaning my partner because he's pursuing acting and is now claiming I'll eventually end up with my ex,  who attempted to rape me after we broke up. Advice needed!  


Background: I started dating my current partner around nine months ago now.  We hit it off immediately,  and it's really just been an incredible experience so far.  We moved in together  for purely financial reasons (we're living in a big city and found an entire apartment for less than $750 a month each - basically unheard of in our location), although its only a month to month sublease so there isn't any real financial risk on either end.  However, even after six months of living together (and my first time living with a partner instead of a roommate), things have remained wonderful. Basically, this guy makes me really happy. 


The issue: The issue we're running into again and again is my mother.  My partner is an actor which, if you couldnt guess, isn't exactly the most lucrative of professions.  Personally I couldn't care  less - he's a harder worker than I,  wakes up at 5am to make it to his two jobs,  and honestly is a damn good actor getting professional work to boot.  It's so obvious that this is his true passion; he just lights over anything to do with acting. I'd never want him to give that up - he wouldn't be the same person I fell for.  


However,  my mom has steadily been getting more aggressive with her dislike of him. It all boils down to her wanting a guy that can ""support me"" and ""treat me right"". She's constantly going on about how my partner has no future,  has thrown away his chances, is a fuck up, and that'll grow bored of him soon.  


At one point she offered him a a part time job with a family business, he quit his previous position to dedicate more time to it,  and she rescinded the offer.  She called him an ""opportunistic scam artist"" for accepting. 


It's getting to the point where she's now talking about my ex and I eventually ending up together. This is a guy who showed up at my apartment 6 months post breakup,  threw me on the bed,  held me down,  and told me he knew ""exactly what I wanted"" all while I struggled. I bit him and threatened to call the cops to get him off of me. The whole relationship was a goddamn nightmare, and she knows *all* the details. Hell, she was furious at him too at the time!  So for her to take his side now, or suggest that I forgive him - all out of dislike for the guy I'm seeing now - is throwing me for a loop.  And also kind of breaking my heart.  


Her comments have gotten to me on a few occasions, and inspired a few sit down talks between my partner and I about finances,  money, and the future. We're on the same page and if anything, those talks brought us closer... but I still feel guilty for letting her get to me during those points and don't want to let it happen again. 


More details: We go 50/50 on essentially all expenses and housework (although he does the cooking).  I graduated recently, and stand to make a decent amount over the next few years - not tons by any means,  but I'm from a pretty low income household and seeing those numbers is still a big deal. My partner is from a pretty well off family - yearly family vacations to Hawaii or Mexico, which is still wild to me.  I think this is making my mother more nervous. 


FWIW neither he nor I want kids, so besides the two of us maintaining enough funds to be happy and healthy,  there isn't anything he'll need to eventually ""support"".


My mom also has clinical psychosis, with hallucinations and bouts of rage (high school was fun). Although when she isn't having an episode,  she seems more or less normal.  This makes knowing when to believe her and when to not *extremely* difficult.  


So,  basically I need help with not letting her comments, jabs,  and constant put downs color my relationship with my partner as well as figuring out a way to make the upcoming holidays not a total cluster fuck when I go home. Thanks all!",relationship_advice

So recently like 2 months ago we started talking again and i didnt think we would be anything serious like that since we always hung out before but nothing happened.

I told my mom about my relationship with my girlfriend and she said ok and said about her and who she is and what her family does and all of the middle eastern parents questions (maybe all parents do that?). After I told her she really didn’t mind it, I then after a couple months told her I would be delighted if she can meet my girlfriend, as all my siblings have met her, she tells me no because she doesn’t want to get involved and is telling me that she has heard good things about her from my siblings but no need for her to meet my mom. My mom also said that she feels like my girlfriends mom is the one pressuring me to make my girlfriend meet my mom, when the actual real case is because I have always been close with my mom, but recently I realized she loves me but under her circumstances. Like she doesn’t want to meet her because she claims “your mind will change with every year to come, finish university and if you’re sure then we will see” I replied with “you say you care but you’re literally not trying to have a relationship with me and trying to watch our relationship rot like a fruit” and continued on that if she’s the one for me I’ll marry her, I don’t care if she’s not muslim like me but I’ll marry her we agreed on teaching the kids which religion and how are life will work if we do end up being meant for eachother. 

My mom had nothing to say but look and say ok. I just hate that she can’t stand beside me and if she truly loves me to care about who is in my life and who I am interested in because I have never told her to meet a girl I was in a relationship before and now that I am she is basically sitting on the sideline. 

I have not told my father about it cuz it will cause me a headache I will tell him when I feel like it’s time to tell him. 

My girlfriend has bought my mom a gift for Christmas and I told my mom that and she says she doesn’t want to accept any gifts, this right here hurts cuz I get that you might be belittling the relationship but like my girlfriend is trying to show you respect and you are not trying to show respect, not only does it make her look bad but it makes me look bad to my girlfriend that my mom wants nothing to do with her! 

I have agreed to talk with my mom about this whole situation after my finals and it will be a big conversation because I want to know how she says she loves me and will support me through everything but is just watching my and her relationship weaken. What should I talk to her about or ask her? Have any of you experienced something like that before?

337,e6kwfz,genocide174,1575568904.0,1,My(26M) cousin(30M) cheated on his wife by fucking my tinder date while on vacation. Help please,"I'm sorry for the length of this post but I felt like all the details included were necessary to draw a conclusion. Also english is not my first language so I'm sorry for any misspelling etc. 

I have a cousin who is by far the worst human I've ever had any form of contact with. I am 100% sure this man is a psychopath/sociopath and the explanation for this is I've seen him do horrendous stuff without the slightest sign of regret. He's also not just any cousin, he's my cousin from both sides of my family. My mother's sister is his mom, and my dad's brother is his father. So we're basically brothers when it comes down to it, despite us being the complete opposite of each other.

This summer, he and I planned to go on a vacation together. I know, this might sound stupid considering what I just wrote above. Let me explain. His parents own a very nice condo in Spain, and I've always wanted to go there. It was also the only vacation period I was going to get, so I saw it as my only chance of getting a vacation outside of the country I live in. I figured I'd ignore him as much as I could and just enjoy the new country I'm in. Boy was I wrong. 

We arrived in Spain and 3 days went by without any big problems, nothing I couldn't handle. On the 4th day however, I told him I want to meetup with a girl I matched with on Tinder. He said no problem. When I asked for the keys to the car we rented (we both paid exactly half) he said no. He argued that since I was leaving him to hang out with someone else I didn't deserve to have the car all by myself. Some of you might point out that he has a point, however what you don't know is that his wife, kid and his wife's entire family was at the same location for vacation, they literally lived 5 minutes away from us. Even though he admitted that he was only going to his wife and kid to hangout, he said that I didn't deserve using the car alone and that he should drop me off and later pick me up again. Considering I know how he functions as a human being, I saw no point in arguing with him because I'll eventually loose. 

I asked the tinder girl for an adress and said I'll meet her there. So when my cousin dropped me off, he said he wanted to see her and just say hi before he leaves, I thought nothing of it and said sure. We all lit a cigarette and I just figured he'd leave afterwards so I can get my mojo on. He didn't leave. Even though I hinted at him to leave us, he just ignored me. 

Me and the girl really hit it off from the get go, but so did she and my cousin. I just brushed it off as ""she's just a really nice girl"". I told the girl I'd bring alcohol and weed (we both told each other that we really like smoking weed) and she was very happy to see that I actually did. 

So about an hour in, I get into the car so I could start rolling a joint. About 5 minutes later when I'm finished I leave the car to find my cousin fingering this girl in an open street. I was shocked but considering all the shit he's done in his life, it just made sense and I felt like an idiot that I didn't realise earlier that this was his plan all along. 

Anyway, he talks her into going back to the condo so we can chill there, instead of outside. Since I was drinking and smoking I didn't drive, but my cousin did. He didn't drink, but he was pretty high. 

During the trip to our condo, I told her quietly that if she's coming back to our condo, it's to fuck me and not my cousin. And I had no plan of sharing the same girl with my horrible older cousin who's married and has a kid. She agrees and told me she only wanted me but that she thought I was okay with it. I wasn't. 

Anyway, when we get back to the condo she and I starts making out and it was clear we both wanted sex, so I carried her into the bedroom thinking I'm getting some tonight. I love going down on girls and this girl was really pretty so I didn't hesitate one bit. 

That's when it happened. As I'm going down on this girl I can see my cousin coming into the room, stopping right next to her head. Then he pulls his dick out. As soon as I saw his disgusting excuse of a penis, I bailed out. I told them I needed to go to the bathroom, but that was obviously a lie. I just went out, smoked a cigarette and tried to calm myself down. 

They obviously had sex, so my cousin was without a doubt unfaithful to his wife. Trust me when I tell you that I've been feeling sick ever since this happened because I see his family pretty regularly. However, it's clear to me that he doesn't give a single shit about what happened. 

The day after it happened, I sat down with him and said we needed to talk. I asked him about what happened the night before, and he just shrugged it off and gave me a ""meh?"". I then asked him ""so if your wife did what you did last night, with another man, you'd be completely fine with it?"" He just denied it. He completely denied it, like the delusional sociopath that he is. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I know for a fact he cheated, and I know that his wife would leave him immediately if she were to find out. My thoughts are, I either tell her now or forever hold my peace. I just feel like she deserves to know what happened because she's about to spend the rest of her life with a filthy human being. 

The only thing keeping me from telling her is the shitstorm that'll most likely occur if I were to tell her. The amount of shit I'll be taking (no matter how right or wrong I am) from some of my relatives is indescribable. I'm from a culture where cheating is basically OK because men believe they're above women. I told my immediate family about what happened and they all told me that I should keep it to myself, that I'll ruin a marriage with a kid involved. 

Any help is appreciated.

338,e6kwd8,throwawayfwbacc,1575568895.0,1,My(26m) fwb(24f) proposed to me last night out of the blue. How do I deal with this?,"Ok shit so how do I put this. Basically I have know her since I was 23 after we got pissed and hooked up in the back of my car. After that turns out she’s actually an alright human being and we end up being friends who dicked around at times. 

So here is the problem. Basically I thought we both knew it was a non romantic fwb relationship. Last week or so ago she out of the blue asked me if we should get married and me being the clueless cunt said of course and that we’d make an amazing husband and wife jokingly cause who the fuck would have thought she was serious. 

Looking back few things kinda make it obvious like the way her mum casually talks about things as if me and beck were actually dating and how she’d sometimes get somewhat upset if I talked about other women. I’d just joke about and say “look at you being jealous” or something like that and it’d be the end of it. We never officially said it was a “no strings attached” kinda thing but I thought it was clear enough. 

Last night she proper gets on a knee and everything and and asks if I’d marry her. Me being me in a jokingly dramatic way yes thinking it’s a joke cause we do shit like this all the time. What added to me thinking it was a joke none of us could keep a straight face and were laughing the whole time. Then we make out and do the deed. then she goes to bed and I leave to go back home and pack cause I had to wake up a bit early. 

So anyway I wake and get a text from her friend (I barely knew and talked to) oh shit I should mention that I didn’t hang out with her friends often cause they were let’s say not my thing and she only hung out with my friends when we went to parties or drinking together. Don’t think she hung out or talked to them otherwise. 

So back to the thing I wake up  to text from her friend congratulating me on our engagement to which I reply “haha”. I get asked a few questions like what are the plans for marriage to which I’m a bit confused and end text Becky about her friends texts. I get two more texts from her other friends congratulating us so I end up calling her and turns out all the things which happened weren’t just a joke and she thought we were actually dating. I tell her my side and explain how I thought we were just friends and didn’t really have romantic interest in her. After me talking all I get is a “ah ok” and she hangs up. She hasn’t been picking my calls up or texting me back and nor are her friends. I have no idea how the fuck this happened . Any advice would be appreciated x",relationship_advice
339,e6kvku,lockdNthrownaway2,1575568804.0,2,I’m (26F) really falling for my boyfriend (29M) but he doesn’t want kids. I’m really conflicted because now I’m considering a childfree lifestyle myself but my family wouldn’t approve.,"I (26F) started seeing my boyfriend (30M) about 3 months ago (we met through OLD) and he honestly amazing. He put himself through college and a masters after his parents died and runs his own business now, he is amazingly kind, thoughtful, handsome, smart, funny and literally everything I could have asked for in a partner…with the exception that he doesn’t want kids.

He did put this on his OLD profile and we did talk about it on our first date. His reasons were that he just never felt the desire to be a parent, and doesn’t feel that that is the lifestyle he wants to have as he gets older. He also cited a few things I hadn’t really considered myself, namely the threat of climate change and also that he feels we’re all “force fed” the idea that we have to have kids from a young age and he just doesn’t agree with that being the “be all end all for fulfillment in life”.  As much as I didn’t want to admit it, I found myself agreeing that he had great points.

I come from a pretty traditional family, I’m an only child, my parents emigrated here from Russia when I was 18 months old and we have literally less than 10 family members between the US and the motherland. It’s basically expected that I have a kid, and I’m turning 27 in a few months so now they’re really getting on me about it. But when I started seeing this guy, and the more I’ve talked to him about not having kids….the more I’m finding myself agreeing with him. I’ve always seen myself becoming a mother at some point, but seeing my boyfriend’s side of things, not having the responsibility of kids, being able to enjoy my time with him and build a life together on our own…it’s starting to seem more and more like the type of future I want. I’m still conflicted because I never pictured myself being childfree as a grown woman, but here I am staring down the barrel of 30 and I still haven’t had a kid. 

My parents have met my boyfriend only last week for Thanksgiving, he even learned Russian (OMG this man <3) and they really like him. Obviously they have no clue that he doesn’t want kids, and I have no idea how we’d ever break that to them. We have talked about it and my boyfriend said that he would approach it however I felt comfortable. He also said that if I really didn’t feel like things would work out because I felt differently about having kids, he would respect my decision. 

So now I’m really conflicted. Obviously this guy is important enough to me that I brought him to meet my family, but now I’m questioning whether the relationship is a good idea, even if he’s a wonderful boyfriend. Then I question my relationship with my parents and wonder if their expectations are unreasonable - don’t I get a say in how my life goes? And do I really even want to have kids? My parents have also been great to me and really worked hard to get to where they are, they’ve always taken great care of me and I love them to pieces. I feel like I have to choose between my partner and my family.

341,e6kufo,Ava1705,1575568672.0,1,My bf (39m) and me (32f) had a fight. We continued the relationship but I feel completely numb and don’t know what to do.,"Hello, 

I’ve been tossing and turning around for two weeks now, maybe someone has advice for me.

My bf and I had a huge fight three weeks ago, on a Wednesday. We used to work together, but I left this summer due to the no intimate relationships at work policy, so we could finally make our relationship official. We used to work together on a daily basis, on every major project of the firm. Me leaving caused a lot of uproar because I worked pretty well and I did a lot of work my bf couldn’t manage due to time issues. Anyway, we had both agreed that me leaving was the right choice and we both were happy to finally be able to announce our relationship to our friends. 

Since I left, he’s under a lot of stress at work, while I found a job that’s better paid and gives me the possibility to work from home. I still support him, though - we are a team and that would never change. He’s been kind of grumpy for six weeks, but stress can do that and I tried my best to be there for him. 

Three weeks ago, however, he called me and told me he didn’t know if he still wanted to see me. He told me everything had broken down at work because I left and maybe it would have been better we had never fallen in love, because then I would still be there and the boss wouldn’t be mad at him for making me leave. (That’s nonsense, btw. The job I have now gives me a lot of opportunities, so I would have left anyway). I was completely stunned, told him we had both agreed me leaving was for the best, told him how happy we had been in the last months and reminded him that only three days ago, he had told me how much he loved me. He replied: well, I forgot about that. I think I forgot everything.

At that point, I hung up. We’ve been through some shit together, his child was very sick and I was there, my father died and he was there and his comment of having forgotten about me made more upset than I have ever been. 

He did not call me on Thursday. I was completely down. On Friday he wrote me a text saying he’d call me Saturday. Mind you, at that point, I was a sleepless, crying mess. I didn’t reply. Instead, i drove off to my sister, 150 miles away from home, deciding to stay there until Sunday. 

On Saturday, he called, but I didn’t want to talk to him because I felt like I needed time to process everything, so I answered and told him I wasn’t home. 

The next day, as I was driving home, he sent me a text saying he didn’t want me to be angry with him but didn’t know what to do. I found that pretty damn stupid, but texted him he could call in the evening. 

He did, told me the situation at work had completely overwhelmed him and that he didn’t know what to do. I told him I wouldn’t discuss this on the phone - that he should at least have the decency to talk to me face to face. He did that two days later, but not because he wanted to break up (which I suspected) but to get me back. He didn’t apologize though.

I took him back, because if there’s one thing I know, I love this man. But things haven’t been the same for me since then. I still love him the same way, but I can’t really tell him, or be affectionate towards him. Something inside me is completely numb. I can’t forget how he told me he had forgotten everything. I want to be like before, carefree, showing my love, but I simply can’t. On the weekend I was with my sister, we had actually booked a vacation together and he wants to do that next weekend instead, but I feel nothing towards it. When he tells me he thinks of me, i feel nothing, except doubt. Does anyone have advice on what I should do now?

First off I want to show him you guys responses. I’ve voiced my opinions and that doesn’t go very far, other people’s seems to matter though. 

When we started dating, I met his family and friends, and hangout with them. One night later on in the relationship he drank so much with me he almost died, I was asleep before that point and had no idea he had did that. It was at his moms house and ever since then, his family has hated me and blamed me, SO we started keeping the relationship from them. His dad is VERY strict, he would take his truck away if he was mad enough, although I don’t know how he really felt about all this or me. I got the alcohol so I understand, I know how they could feel. Aside from that, there’s been petty back and forth moments where we broke up and got back together the next day, but that’s it.

His family not knowing is one thing, but NONE of his friends know now either. In fact a mutual friend that’s close to him blocked me on Instagram when we used to talk sometimes, I’m under the assumption he told him we weren’t dating so it was weird we would be talking. I’m not sure. When it comes to not telling his friends we are dating, he’s only told me “BLANK knows my mom he would tell her..” and that his sister is on social media so she would see things and tell his parents. Yet he could tell them not to say anything, I do feel like. I accepted this. 

He has a best female friend who he met through his friend, while we were dating and they talk a lot and send each other songs. She lives 3 hours away from us so they don’t hangout but have. He follows her dog and mom on Instagram, his sister followed her and vice versa, Shes a part of his friend group. She’s more involved and included in his life more then I am, and has a positive presence. I feel like he enjoys talking to her more too. That fact makes me almost feel like he’s building a relationship with her and sees her as more of a person with future potential than me. He has said he wouldn’t date her though she’s just a friend. I hate the idea that he sees her differently or likes her more. I can’t tell if I’m overreacting feeling the way I do. He is dating me though. According to us. And strangers.. Yet all his friends and sister knows she exists now but I don’t. She doesn’t know. 

If she’s a good friend wouldn’t she understand the situation? Or is he hiding this all for the fact he’s embarrassed of me when it comes to friends and doesn’t want to look bad since we’ve broken up and he came back? Or am I overreacting, considering I have agreed along the way to this. He tells me he wants to be with me. He comes off as all this is to make sure we can be together. I’m confused. Does he REALLY want to be with me all this considered? Is this in ANY WAY okay? 


TLDR;I’m[23]f in a relationship where nobody knows we are dating, my boyfriends[20]m best female friend has more prominence in his life then I do and doesn’t know I exist either despite living 3 hours away, and we also hangout mostly at night. He’s given reasons to “justify” those things and treats me well though. Everything else is okay and he told me he wants to be with me, and acts as if things are like this so we can be. According to us and strangers that is. So along with advice to me, as an outside opinion I can share with him from you guys, is this relationship really okay?",relationship_advice

I posted this in a gay subreddit but I'll repost it here for other opinions.

So we've been going out for about 5 years now and we've broken up a few times (long distance problems). During our like 2-4th year, he almost never sucked my dick or did anything to me aside from kissing/hugging/giving me a massage when I asked for one. It was actually the cause of our first breakup as I felt like he wasn't even interested in me sexually and just expected me to suck his dick all the time (honestly, I love sucking dick so it wasn't really a ""bad thing"" but I just felt like I wasn't getting anything in return).

Suddenly during the past 3 or so months, he's been super enthusiastic about sucking me and making me happy by licking below my balls and rimming me out of nowhere when before, I'd have to ask him to do anything. I mean it's definitely a nice change but at the same time, almost every time I get urge to ask him if he's sure he's happy doing this or if he's doing it to make me happy and I can't ever seem to get comfortable with the fact that he's going down on me happily and voluntarily.

Cross posting from other advice subs because I need all the help I can get. I'm the worst at titles, RIP.

So some background first. (I've indicated where you can start if you wanna skip the background lol)

I've (26F) been seeing this guy (33M) for closer to 4 months and this short period of time has honestly been a life changing experience. I've learned that I deserve to be treated better than I'd been treated in the past. It opened my eyes to how badly men had been gaslighting me, how much disrespect I had allowed, etc.

I also feel like I've become an overall better person. He's honestly been a great influence on my life. One of those people that help give you motivation to better yourself, you know? I've found myself overall less irritable, more calm, more responsible, etc. I still struggle with major anxiety and depression, especially related to dating, but that is something I am working on (medications, therapy, etc).

A few weeks ago (2-3), I brought up that I didn't want to see anyone else and he agreed. We also agreed that we still wanted to take it slow before really committing to each other. We were both fine with this.

A couple days ago he mentioned he was feeling tired, beaten down and depressed.

From what I know: For the past month he's been working 6 days a week, 12-14h shifts where his company expects him to do the work of three different jobs by himself. He recently started 3 online classes to which aren't exactly light in terms of workload. To top it all off, he broke his arm 2 weeks ago. So now he can't do many of the things that would bring him some joy (working out, video games, etc). So basically, it's understandable how he's feeling. I asked if there's anything else going on that could be affecting him and he said there isn't.

Because of how he's been feeling I haven't been hearing from him as much. I called him yesterday to check on him and, long story short, he ended up saying that he's so tired and busy and it's hard to make time for anything else, including me. That he's having trouble feeling happy, wanting to hangout with anyone, text anyone, etc. He was extremely respectful and cognizant of my feelings and how he may be hurting my feelings. I was supportive but still honest about my feelings, needs and boundaries (this was a big step for me. I've never been good at that.)

Eventually the conversation got around to us and I suggested taking some time apart so he could evaluate how he feels about this and if he wants to continue or not.

Although he didn't sound sure of what he wants, I have a strong feeling that when he calls me on Friday, it'll be to end things between us.

While I really hope this isn't the case, I also understand him needing to do so. His mental health comes first, relationships can come later.

START HERE (to skip background info)

After all that overexplanation, (sorry) I've decided to start getting ready to move on. I'm in grad school and have responsibilities with my family at home, so I can't afford to fall apart like I have several times in the past.

So I'm here asking for tips and advice on how to move on from something that is incredibly special to me. It would be easier if he just didn't like me or wanted someone else. It's just a case of unfortunate circumstances and bad timing (fuck bad timing :()

Any advice, words of wisdom etc are welcome. Thank you guys!

My partner and I have been together for 4 months. I’ve put a lot of energy into this relationship and at times it’s quite draining. I love to spend time and energy with her, but it’s very important that I have my own space too. I’m what some consider a highly sensitive empath so I often find myself very drained when I’m around people too much, even when it’s people I really love. 

This past week I’ve been feeling very drained and I haven’t had much time for myself. Only twice in the past week have I asked for some me time. However when I tell my partner this, she gets very upset and seems to take it very personally. This leads to a bunch of messy communication that is so difficult to navigate and then I find myself still being sucked of energy when I just needed to relax and spend time with myself. 

She doesn’t seem to understand my perspective, although there have been many times when she wants a night to herself and I happily support that. 

What would be the best way to communicate this? I’ve tried my best to stay calm and still reassure her that I love her and that it’s BECAUSE I love her that I need my own time. It just isn’t working out and the need for my own space turns into me hurting her feelings and then losing all of the time for myself bc my attention and energy is still all going to her.

I wasn't comfortable with this, and haven't been for the entirety of the time we've been dating (1 year) and have explicitly told both of them this separately, though both denied any wrongdoing and said they were just friends. I know they are just friends, but I know that he used to like her, and tells her private details about our relationship (that I don't want to do anal, that I don't like sending nudes, etc) and have only found out from him that he has told her that. She hasn't made it known that she knows these things. I'm annoyed that when we're together she can sit across from me, knowing intimate and personal things about me, and not say one word about it.

My husband and I get along great and the relationship is great except that we don't have sex as often as either of us would like to. And by that I mean it is pretty rare.

I have known this girl (let's call her Sarah) since high school, and became best friends towards the end of it. She is the person I care the most outside of my family, and vice versa. We have been in multiple relationships each, and have had many double dates and so on. She perfectly knows I have no romantic feelings towards her.  
For the last year I started thinking in the back of my mind that she might have feelings towards me, led by some small (and some not-so-small) things:

* Sarah picked up my hobbies without me being around to drag her with me there (we live away from each other). This of course is an amazing thing, but it rang a tiny bell in my head when she was onto the *third* of my hobbies/sports. 
* As this is very subjective I cannot be sure, but I have a feeling a lot of the guys Sarah dates resemble me in one or multiple ways. Things I've noticed and some (seemingly irrelevant) things she has mentioned have left me with the impression that in the end, her type could easily just be *me*.
* She once mentioned, while we were talking about a date of mine, that *I am everything one could want.* Weird thing to say, and I later thought she might have said so being emotionally distressed by the conversation as the said date is a close friend of hers.  
* And the spiciest for last, when we visit each other we sleep in the same bed (well, only if it's only one but this is the majority of cases). We are both very affectionate and enjoy cuddling - so we always do, although I try my best to not get my privates close to her. I do love her as a friend with my whole heart and enjoy cuddling her, but recently it was brought to my attention that cuddling is extremely sexual and over the boundaries of a *regular* friendship. 

With Sarah being my closest friend, I have nobody to share these things with. I could talk with my parents but I know that their view is ""*it is impossible for opposite sexes to be just (close) friends*"" because they have mentioned it before in a different context. I'm concerned because we have been best friends for so long that if she has feelings, they must be extremely deep at this point. Such feelings will definitely affect our relationship if said out loud, so I am scared to ask her directly. On the other hand, keeping all this bottled makes me overthink everything she says, thinking it has a double meaning. I have also significantly (from my POV) reduced talking about my romantic relationships as I don't want to hurt her even slightly. This is a huge problem for me as I feel like I'm betraying her when telling other friends but not her. 

I don't have *any* romantic feeling towards Saraj, and I can hardly imagine being in a relationship with her as she is very far from my type. I just really, really want to keep her as my friend and not fall off, but I don't think this is possible if she is in love with me.  How can I deal with my situation as in, do you think there's a high chance she is in love? Is it possible to keep the friend-relationship if so? How can I stop feeling guilty when talking with her about other girls? 

*She uses Reddit and I sincerely hope she doesn't see this.*",relationship_advice

354,e6kluk,Donilock,1575567674.0,1,How do I (M19) help a fellow student (F18) without appearing romantically interested?,"(English is not my mother tongue, so I apologize in advance if something may seem strange in my writing)

As the title suggests, I'm in a rather complicated situation currently, and I feel some context need to be given first about the people involved.

Firstly, there is me (M19). I've recently entered a university and I've been studying at that place for 3 months already. I've always been the top student among my peers, but also very introverted and a bit shy and awkward at times. What you really need to know, as it seems to me, is that I have rather poor social skills and, despite often willingly preferring to spend time in solitude, know how horrible it can feel to be lonely, ignored and left out.

In recent months, however, I feel like my situation has improved quite a bit, and I think it is mostly because I met a wonderful girl from my group at the university (F17, let's call her Anna for convenience). She always smiles and laughs, is very cheerful and has something interesting to tell. She is genuinely one of the smartest students I've ever met and is very diligent and hard-working. Also, she writes nice poems, even though she reluctantly shares them. To say that I like her would be an understatement, and I believe she also likes me. We do spend quite a lot of time together, and although I previously stated that I am not good at conversations, I discovered that I am able to talk with her regularly for quite some time without running out of things to say. We are not in any kind of ""official"" relationship yet, but I truly believe we can be a great couple.

However, had things been this perfect I wouldn't have made this post. In the same group, there is also another female student (F18, let's call her Beatrice for the sake of convenience). She is a very quiet girl, preferring silence to socializing. She is into animation, draws nice art (doesn't like sharing it, unfortunately) and is also, like Anna, quite skilled in writing poetry. She may not be the best student in the group, but I can clearly see that she always works hard and puts a lot of effort into her work, even when the task is difficult. She seems to be pretty shy and awkward when she needs to speak, but she always gives it her best.

I'll be honest here: I'm not interested in Beatrice, but I believe that had I not met Anna I maybe would have had more gentle feelings towards her.

However, Beatrice at times simply reminds me too much of myself in my school years. She never talks to anyone, rarely smiles, lacks confidence when speaking and just simply looks sad most of the time. I often feel guilty, like some kind of hypocrite, complaining about feeling lonely and ignored while simultaneously subjecting others to the same feelings. I desperately want to help her, cheer her up, give her confidence and just make her smile and feel better about herself, but I'm very afraid that due to my lack of experience with people I'll somehow ""send her wrong signals"" and make it look like I am romantically interested in her despite only wanting to be helpful. I fear that since she doesn't seem to have anyone else talking to her on a regular basis, she will grow too attached to me, and I will accidentally hurt her feelings by telling her that I have no romantic feelings towards her.

So, here is more or less the entire situation. What would you recommend me to do? How can I help Beatrice and not create a huge mess in the process? I thank you for your help in advance.",relationship_advice

I know I probably should've done a better job and my cheating didn't help with that afterwards. I've also been told that once a relationship is torn by cheating it can't be mended. We did everything my psychologist said we should and so I'm left here wondering what else needs to be done.

359,e6khqa,americasnxttopsurgry,1575567215.0,1,My (25M) mother (66F) has been depressed since her divorce 10 years ago and I can’t take it any more.,"TLDR at bottom

When I was 15, my mom and dad separated. It was initiated by him, however, it was amicable in the sense that there was no fighting over possessions, custody, etc. My mom was devastated; this got even worse a few months later when I mentioned he had started dating. My entire teenage years were consumed by attending to her wellbeing: when she stayed out late drinking, I would wait up to make sure that she didn’t drive home drunk. I spent almost every night in the room with her after she told me she didn’t want to live anymore. I took care of myself while she spent time in a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I supported her through a series of abusive relationships, and tried to offer advice during the breakups. As result I was never able to live out my teenage years with any normalcy. 

After graduating high school, I moved to a different state for college and I am now enrolled in the MA program of my dreams. Every time we talk on the phone, it eventually turns back to my dad, how she is still in love with him, and how miserable and lonely she is. When I bring up things in my life, she would never pay attention, or she acts very happy for me but seems almost jealous of my accomplishments, as though I had abandoned her. Now she doesn’t know me at all. I am gay, and came out of the closet as trans a few years ago, but I can’t share any of that with her because I know it would make her even more depressed. 

She has repeatedly asked me why we aren’t close anymore and will sometimes break down and apologize for being a horrible mother during my teenage years, while at the same denying that certain behaviors ever happened (she claimed that a 6 month relationship with an incredibly creepy man was ‘just a few dates’). But then she projects her emotions onto me and tells me she “knows” how devastated I must feel from the divorce. She recently spent 6 weeks in a psychiatric hospital, which was spurred by finding out my father is engaged, and she doesn’t seem to have made any progress towards getting well. 

At this point I feel helpless, since nothing I do has an effect on her. She breaks up with someone who is emotionally abusive and my brother and I offer support and affirmation, and then she gets back together with him so she doesn’t have to be alone. I feel very guilty for not wanting her in my life, especially because she has alienated so many people with her depression; I am worried she will hurt herself if I am honest about needing space. Any advice for how to move forward is appreciated. 

TLDR: my mom has struggled with severe mental illness since her divorce, and I have tried to help all I can, but I resent her and don’t know what else to do now.",relationship_advice
360,e6kgvx,moanaa_33,1575567114.0,1,I really need advice...,"Am I a terrible friend for this ???

need friend advice....

I had this friend who I’ve known for years....   (sorry it might me long) 

we hung out with these 2 guys...but I noticed my friends crush (thing1) would have more of a conversation with me. This guy seemed like he was more interested in getting to know me to even complementing me on how pretty I would look right infront of my friend and his.

Long story short my friend and thing1 were talking since he had to in order to be close to me since he started everything off on the wrong foot and didn’t know how to tell me his feelings bc he thought I was still talking to his friend..this resulted in my friend really doing whatever she could to get him to notice her, but I wasn’t 100% sure at the time that this guy thing1 had a real crush on me... more than him being nice and complimenting me sometimes. he just seemed like a really nice friend and we had a lot in common. But yet he wasn’t all that innocent he at times would lead her on & any little thing he would do my friend would get the wrong signals and hope of something which was never there. So this must have all been less than 2months when my friend was still trying sooo hard for him to take the next step in really dating and being official.. but this guy just felt so much pressure and kept telling her he didn’t really feel the same until one day he really went off and let her know it was going to be nothing and I can’t remember at that time what he might have said but time went by like couples months and we connected again and he finally tells me he really liked me and wanted to see where it went. I was conflicted because I had gotten to know him during the time we were all friends and I thought he was really nice and again we had a lot in common. 

I didn’t know how to tell my friend because she literally had become obsessed with this guy it seemed like she really insisted and wanted this guy so bad and I just knew it would hurt her, but at the same time I felt like she knew deep down that he didn’t want her and she was still chasing him around and got her hopes up for nothing when all the signs were there and she didn’t care.

Me and my friend go out to eat one day and she starts telling me how she always felt like this guy thing 1 really liked me and wanted to know me. I told her that I thought that as well but I wasn’t so sure because maybe he was just being nice ..by the time thing 1 confessed to me his feelings I later decided to have a serious convo with her and let her know what thing 1 told me...I never had a guy really Persue me and take so much interest in me he let me know how bad he felt about my friend and he even apologized to her and wanted to move forward. 

My friend ofcourse made it a huge deal I told her I was torn between wanting to see where it goes with this guy, yet hurting her because I knew she liked him. but I told her that she knows me best and knows I would never purposely try to hurt her in any way and even tho that happened with that guy she knows my heart and knows what I’ve been through I finally meet this guy and because of the terrible circumstances I feel bad it ever happened that way and i would never do such a thing unless I was 100% he was serious about me.. next thing you know we give it a try and 2years later we are still together doing amazing and seeing a future together. 

so moving forward I thought we would pull through from it but her anger and grudge only grew bigger despite of her now dating his cousin she holds this grudge and jealousy over me talking about me behind my back and trying to humiliate me. She’s now within my bfs family since she’s dating the cousin.

Im in such a bad situation with her because of all the drama she’s caused in between for so long I felt terrible because of how it happened and now I’m just exhausted of looking like the bad guy even tho I feel like I did all I could as a friend to speak up and let her know what was going on and trying to be an adult about it. But she stayed being so immature and getting her family involved.

&#x200B;

Last night my BF came over to have a nice night together. It turned into a shit show. We were having a nice time, drinking wine, and talking, and he was just looking at something on his phone intently. I walked over to see what it was and it was literally a girl's ass (not mine, on reddit) spread open, use your imagination. I was like wtf? I grabbed his phone and scrolled down and saw like 15 more of those he was just looking at. Then I went to his Instagram to see if he was searching any porn there. Nope but what I saw was worse. He had recently searched his ex-girlfriend, whom he previously emotionally cheated on me with. The issues with her have almost ruined our relationship several times. Of course, I get upset and begin to cry. He has lied to me many times about this ex of his and their contact with each other, even after he told me he cut of contact with her, he lied and was still talking to her. It's been about a year since that last happened and (I thought) he's been proving to me it is all kosher. He told me he is never going to talk to her u/ I am freaking out, crying, and saying I'm over this, this is the final straw, I can't believe you're doing this to me again. He waits for me to calm down then tells me her grandmother messaged him to tell him that she has a serious illness and he went to her instagram page to see if that was true. He said it was 2 months ago. I don't believe that he hasn't been looking her up since then. She was in his recent searches, albeit at the bottom, but still in recents. We argue. I firmly believe he should've let me know her grandmother reached out to him regarding her. I said I don't care the context of the conversation, as his current LONG TERM girlfriend I have a right to know if an ex/ex's family member reaches out ESPECIALLY since it's the one he has been unfaithful to me with. He said he never messaged her and if he wanted to, he would ask me and ultimately, I would have the last say. He deleted the messages from the grandmother, which I told him is not  a good look.

&#x200B;

The arguing continues. We're in bed. He's raising his voice, I keep telling him to shhh. I keep trying to go to sleep, and he will continue talking, saying I don't know why I'm even here, if I leave we're done with this relationship, then asking me if I want him to leave. I just kept saying no I just want to go to bed. Eventually, I sat up and told him to shhhh and he hit/shoved me in the back. I have a bruise now. This isn't the first time he's been physical with me. He slapped me in the face in July. He went to counseling. I thought things were better. 

This morning he's all apologetic about the porn and hitting thing, repeating himself over and over again. He said I ""bruise like a banana"" and he's not using it as an excuse but I was making him really angry. Classic manipulative talk. He said he was looking at the naked photo because he was getting excited about us having sex that night. I told him, I don't care he watches porn by himself, and if he was to come to me about wanting to watch porn together that's different, but that it disgusts me he was looking at another girls cooch while sitting next to me. He still does not believe he's in the wrong for not telling me about his ex. I couldn't even look him in the eye and told him he disgusts me right now. I told him I need space and he left. As he was leaving he took the sports bra I was wearing last night (which btw is high neck, and goes almost to my belly button, more like a shirt) and said, you're not wearing this to your workout classes are you? I said no but I was planning on it, and it's not like it's revealing, and even if it is, I can wear whatever I want. He said ok well maybe I just needed to get a better look at it. Then he left. 

So, reddit, is this something to be forgiven or should I cut my losses?

To start, we’ve been together for a little over 6 months and things have been going beautifully. We fell in love very quickly and we’re still very happily in the honeymoon phase. We’ve never argued, we see eye to eye on every important topic we’ve discussed, and overall we’re very similar as people. He’s hands-down the best partner I’ve ever had and I see this relationship lasting a long time. 

From the beginning I noticed he had a lot of feminine qualities. This was a huge plus for me. He and I are both bisexual, and my taste skews toward effeminate men and masculine women, so I was pretty excited about having a boyfriend comfortable with femininity. He wears women’s underwear often, which is the first thing I noticed. At first I thought this was a fetish, and I suppose it is, but he wears lingerie pretty often outside of sex, just in his daily life. Lately he’s become much more feminine. He’s started painting his nails, wearing his hair longer, and recently shaved his legs. He’s also mentioned being interested in buying dresses and feminine clothes. A couple weeks ago he directly called himself a girl, but in a passing jokey way that I almost missed. On top of this, while it doesn’t necessarily mean anything, a couple of his close friends are trans women. 

I realize all of that doesn’t mean he’s questioning his gender or may be a woman. He might just be a more-feminine-than-most man. I’m absolutely fine with all of this either way.

During the weekend of veterans day I signed up for grindr, shared adult pictures of myself, and met up with two other student users
I believe i was and still am partially mentally ill, suffering from depression and anxiety. I became convinced that if I didn’t explore my sexuality now i never would be able to. Both instances were a living nightmare for me and ended quickly, it was only disgusting and painful for me, the only reason I didn’t leave sooner was out of shock/embarrassment. They were so traumatic that I no longer believe i am bisexual. Ever since then I have been actively trying to convince myself that I had dreamed it, I thought maybe if I repeat it enough my brain will eventually believe it, i no longer believe this is a healthy coping method and think it has only lead to further mental issues. 
In conclusion I understand i have committed a heinous act and that there is no truly valid excuse for it. I must live with the burden of that, if that burden includes you no longer loving me I must accept that. Though it may no longer mean much to your ears, I do love you, and believe you are the only person for me, I apologize for not telling you this earlier, through various efforts i am only now beginning to emerge from a fog of misery and self delusion. I hope you can find it in your heart to move past this mistake of mine as you have done so in the past, I understand that there is only so much you can take though, and if this is too much then i truly am sorry and just want you to know that the time we’ve spent together has meant everything to me.",relationship_advice
368,e6k5uu,ThrowRA1011,1575565825.0,2,[29M] My girlfriend (24F) is starting to show red flags in our 2 year relationship.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I don't know if I'm overthinking or overreacting but I'd like to get some advice, opinions and conversations with people who have had similar experiences.

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly two years. They have been some of the happiest times of my life. I feel we work very well together and find the urge to propose often. We have a place together and I spend nearly every moment outside of work with her (we both work long hours in the same industry which has killed our social lives).

Recently we were having a serious conversation to resolve a recent conflict. We both tend to shut down when the other is angry/upset and it's been an ongoing process for us to learn and communicate effectively in those situations. They don't happen often but normally creates a day of awkward tiptoeing around each other afterwards.

Anyways, we came up with a plan to share and communicate our feelings and all seemed well. Not soon after, she mentions she wants to bring something up with her therapist regarding our relationship, that she was wondering about the idea of an open relationship....

Some background. She started seeing a therapist recently due to sex anxiety and low libido. This has been a problem for us for the last 6 months or so and apparently a problem for her previous relationships as well. Initially we'd have sex 2-3 times a week or more but that has dwindled to about once a month. I understand and it hasn't been a big issue because I enjoy her presence.

Some more background. We met in college while we were both in open relationships. We became friends over the course of a few weeks, which progressed into a few hookups. I graduate and start working but we stay in touch and grab drinks, go for walks/hikes once in a while. Long story short we catch feelings for each other and start dating monogomously. 

Back to original story. She's previously mentioned to me how she was done with that part of her life (open relationships and sleeping around) and enjoys what she has with me. So naturally I am very surprised and hurt to hear she had been mulling over those thoughts again. She says it's helped take 'pressure' off of her relationships in the past. I tell her the thought of that hurt's me and explain why. I tell her how I feel about her and our relationship, which is me being 100% committed to it and very deeply in love. She tells me she loves me but doesn't feel the same about the relationship. She doesn't want to leave me and says if she can't make a relationship work with me she can't make it work with anyone. None of her relationships have lasted much past 2 years. I have no reason to believe she has ever been unfaithful to me in the past or will be in the future. She reassured me the same. I trust her.

This assymetry of love and commitment has me hurt and concerned for the future of the relationship. She's been out of town for work so I haven't had the chance to further talk about this with her. In hindsight, I can see the assymetry. She's gotten more distant, more curt, and wanting more personal time and space. I know she's working through some things in therapy and I want to understand, help, and support her.

I guess I just don't know how to proceed. I completely fell for her. I feel hurt. I don't want to act like everything's fine only to be hurt again. We have a lease for another 6 months and I cannot afford it without her. I want to work things out with her, I love her. I don't know what to do. I trust her to be faithful to our relationship but I don't see us lasting if her feelings don't change. I can't help but feel a little resentment and have started distancing myself emotionally. I feel like now I need to proceed in the relationship with caution and the thought that we might not make it.

TL;DR : My girlfriend has been thinking about wanting an open relationship and has confided that she doesn't share the same feelings about our relationship but still loves me. I feel hurt and don't know what to do.",relationship_advice
369,e6k5u0,glittertoes1,1575565822.0,1,Being cheated on made me feel become crazy and toxic. Learned some things you can’t forget. How do I move on?,"Being together after being “cheated” on drove me crazy

Our relationship was relatively normal. We broke up and still saw each other casually, being very young and in college I didn’t want any obligation. I found out he was seriously and exclusively dating someone else and seeing me on the side. I felt lied to and undervalued. I told the girl and really lashed out because I was so hurt. I felt so betrayed and insecure. I went out the top with messaging the girl and same to her, but we were both hurt and I was just reacting.

Years later we got back together. I’ll ask him why he got into a relationship, but he refuses to answer or says it none of my business. I love him and have a huge connection to him, but the thought and memory keeps coming up in my mind. I’m trying to work through this, but it’s driving me crazy. We fight now and before this happened everything was fine. He did not technically cheat on me, but for some reason I cannot stomach the thought.

He thinks I’m crazy because of this and just wants to move on with no discussion or explanation. I don’t think he wants to accept fault and doesn’t get why I’m still hurt. I’m finally ending it. We constantly fight and I cry all the time by the hurt he caused me. It just sucks because I do love him and the good is good. 

I made a lot of effort to make it work or try to get over it, but I can’t. I do trust him yet I can’t do it. I turned into someone toxic and bad because I felt so used. Any one else feel this way? Is this normal? I’m finally ending it for good. I’m choosing to love myself and move on. Being with him made me hate myself.",relationship_advice

My fiancé and I started dating about 3 years ago, when I started dating her I’d recently gotten out of a 4 month relationship that was very unhealthy.  So looking back I know I didn’t stay single long enough and instead jumped right into a relationship with my fiancé.  

The beginning of the relationship was a ton of fun! We’d go on fun dates and stay up super late and just talk about life in general, we were both really happy. 

So our relationship moved really fast, within 6 months I was living in her apartment and sharing all the bills 50/50. A year later I decided to propose, she obviously said yes.

One of the weak points of our relationship has always been the sexual piece, we’ve very vanilla and there’s zero passion to anything we do, it’s always been like that. Well 6 months after the engagement I decided to start posting nudes on reddit. I instantly fell in love with it! It was such a huge confidence boost and I realized that people actually find me really attractive. This was the start of the decline...I realized that I don’t really love my fiancé and that I’ve been with her because I didn’t think anyone else would love me and I pity her.  Our sex life is also almost non existent, maybe 4 times a month. It’s always the most vanilla sex, when I’ve talked about wanting much more.

Now we fight every other day and I try to lay hints that I want to leave but she always breaks down, when she does I feel terrible and make her feel better.  I want to leave but we have a dog together, joined bank accounts, and a house together. Here and I just started going to therapy separately but I don’t think it will help, I just want to leave and never look back. 

How do I do this? Am I a bad person and wanting too much?",relationship_advice

We got pretty close as it lasted eight months and we were completely exclusive. I definitely liked him but, I wasn't in a place to be in a committed relationship. At the end of my freshman year of college I went back home for the summer and since he had just graduated he stayed in our college town. I decided when I left that I wasn't going to try and contact him and that I'd just reconnect with him after summer. About a week after school ended he started texting me just like asking how I'm doing and I went on a study abroad trip and he really kept up with that which was nice. We stayed in touch over the summer probably talking a couple times a week. He kept asking me to visit so eventually I did. I actually visited him and stayed at his moms house who's also deaf. I don't think he's brought a single girl from school to his home to meet his mother. I went back home for about 3 more weeks until I went back to school in August. When I got back to school he was being weird and flaky to me and I knew he'd probably been hooking up with other people but, it turns out he had a girlfriend and they'd been dating for about a month. I found out through a mutual friend and I told him how I couldn't believe he'd done that and it wasn't fair to do that to me. I told his girlfriend and she got upset at hime but, they're still dating. He apologized in person and that was nice but, I was mad for a while. I unfollowed him on social media just to give myself a cleanse. A few weeks ago he followed me back and that's how we started speaking again. He invited me to smoke a blunt with him and it was nice to see him but, I was definitely a little anxious. Anyways, last night I texted him asking for one of his colleagues numbers so I could contact them for a paper I have to write and he asked me to hangout again. I was hesitant but he came over and we ended up just talking until about 4 am. It honestly was pretty deep and he was being affectionate but, not in a way that was aggressive. I know we both enjoy each others company a lot. He ended up sleeping over and we slept with our heads together just really close but, we didn't hookup in any form or fashion. He still has a girlfriend. I just need some help interpreting this because I don't know what the fuck is going on.",relationship_advice

So around 2 month ago I got married to the LOML and I feel like it's been kinda sucky since . I feel like I'm constantly asking him to have sex with me and he never initiates. I feel like I'm bothering him and he's mentioned to me that I'm always asking and if I didn't ask so much maybe he would just do it himself (try and have sex with me without being asked to). We spoke about a open relationship a few months before getting married bc of this and he promised he'd change and that he'd try to initiate more, he even got us a few sex toys to ""spark"" things up but it was literally like a month of using those things then boom! back to the same stuff. He always has time for everything he wants to do (video games , cook ,watch TV) but when it comes to having sex he tells me ""we'll have sex tonight, I swear."" We get in bed, he puts a show on & next thing I know he's passed out or I am. WTF DO I DO? Why am I not enough for this man? Before I left for work yesterday I tried giving him a blowjob and managed to get him going and told him I didn't care to be late bc I really wanted to have sex with him and he literally told me to go to work and that we'd have sex ""later"". Well night rolls around , he's closing the bar so I know he'll be home late, def not expecting sex when he gets home but he has work in the AM and always gives himself time to read his books' or go through Reddit and eat breakfast so this morning while he was in the shower , I got him work clothes ready , got him everything he needed to start his day hoping and praying we'd have sex cuz we both have a wierd schedule today and won't be seeing each other til later tonight but omg no . He walked out , gets dressed , got his drink and came to kiss me goodbye. I asked if he was forgetting anything and asked if he had extra time to have a ""quickie"" (mind you I purposely had gotten his things ready so he def had about a spare 20 min) and he said ""It's my first time opening and I can't be late! I promise, tonight. I was horny in the shower too but I'm going to be late now if we do (have sex)"". I wanted to cry. Well I actually did as soon as he left . He just messaged me apologizing saying he didn't get enough sleep. Dude it's always something. What do I do?? I spoke to him about a open relationship again and he said that it would be a deal-breaker and that he's changed his mind about it . I would never do anything behind his back or anything to hurt him but I'm getting tired of ""being alone "" in sex while being married .  Not really sure what to do. I've bought lingerie for myself to kinda switch things up , I've bought him ""sex coupons"" for any time of the day type of rendezvous, done the whole lot and still nothing. I feel helpless and when I try giving him the cold shoulder he just lets me get over it. We've spoken about this so many times in the last couple of months that now he'll know why I'm upset and won't ask. I'm 26!!!! Not 106!!! My sex life is stale and sucks and I feel like I'm stuck with someone who doesn't give a fuck about changing that !!!!

Every time we’re watching something and a redhead comes on the screen, I do look to see if he’s looking more intently. It’s sad, I know.

376,e6k2yk,ThrowRAyeetyahgang,1575565505.0,1,"Me (25M) and my (now ex) gf (23F) have had a very rough year, but I still want to make amends in our relationship","I had been writing out a super long post detailing the relationship, but I figure I should just write a short version of the most relevant details to post instead.

&#x200B;

At the start of the year, after my gf essentially agreed to give someone else my money (while she owed me money), I tried to break up with my gf. We were moving out of our apartment and I was moving back in with my mom while trying to finally finish university. I left it up to my gf if she wanted to come live at my mom's house, because she still needed a place to live and I wasn't going to abandon her. So she came to live with me, but our dynamic didn't really change. We still acted like we were in a relationship, so its as if we never really broke up.

&#x200B;

We argued pretty frequently, but not very productively. She refused to identify with my point of view and it continually hurt my feelings. During intimacy, I was experiencing a lot of pain and so I was feeling very not appreciated and even somewhat physically hurt/used. Unfortunately, in July I made a mistake. While on a trip with friends, I slept with a pretty close friend of mine. I did not want to tell my gf after returning home because I was embarrassed and honestly did not feel obligated to tell her. This has quickly turned into the biggest regret of my life.

&#x200B;

A few weeks after that trip, my gf had started a difficult conversation with me. An old friend of hers had shown interest, and had invited her on a date in a nearby city in which he had a hotel room during a business trip. I was very offended by this. To me, it was very clearly an offer for a one night stand and I was greatly upset that my gf could even consider doing something like that while living at my (sick) mom's house. I told her I was not okay with her going off with some guy then returning home the next day like nothing happened. I was very hurt by this. (Yes, I'm hypocritical) During this argument, she expressed that she was sad and confused because she didn't know what my feelings were. I told her the truth, I told her that she was still the only person I was interested in but she had hurt my feelings at the start of the year and never really apologized so we never really worked out the issues we had. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, by the fall, I'm a mess. I convinced her to move back to her home state (after supporting her through getting a job, then supporting and encouraging her to transfer) so that she could be closer to family and friends. Now I'm living without any real friends nearby, and I'm miserable. Two months ago, I confessed that I had slept with another girl over the summer. She (obviously) took it very poorly. In the last two months, my (now ex) gf has become more and more angry with me. My psychiatrist, my friends, her friends, and my family (all of whom I've asked for advice) have said that my ex gf is being very toxic and manipulative/controlling. I'm more hurt than I've ever been.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The thing to recognize here, is that I do not expect to just be easily forgiven for what I did. I know I am far from deserving forgiveness. I visited my gf a few weeks after confessing to her (as was already a planned trip) and I brought a bunch of gifts with me, and bought her multiple gifts while visiting. We slept together twice, even though she was mad at me. After the second time, she said ""I love you"" for the first time in a while and it made me so happy. But after that trip, she said she didn't want to see me again for a while. I've made many attempts at communicating, and expressing that I want to have a mature conversation in order to resolve things. The more I try, though, the more I have been called controlling or manipulative. She's been destroying my confidence and I'm feeling more miserable now than I ever have.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know that I was wrong. I know she deserves to be angry. But the reason I realized what I had done wrong and apologized and told her how much I loved her was because I recognized my mistakes. I realized that relationships aren't simple and easy. There will always be a point where complications arise, and you must confront them. I truly believed I was doing the right thing by apologizing and committing to making things better. For her to abandon me when I needed her most has hurt more than anything. I feel so lost and lonely, and I know that I can just rebound and move on or something, but I absolutely don't want that. I want to do the hard work. I want to try hard. I want to put in the effort for her. We had something truly genuine, and I believe the best thing is to work to fix that instead of just giving up and moving on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The other night, I left the group chat I was in with her friends. When she asked me why, I told her how sad I was and that I needed to create that space. She had been saying for two months that she wants space, so I finally listened. Now, I've left everything up to her. She has started being interested in someone new. Her friends aren't really thrilled about this person, and I am absolutely heartbroken over her trying to move on. When I told her that we couldn't really be friends, and that I was hurting too much, she said she was genuinely sorry and immediately asked if I was still moving near to her (as had been my plan to transfer to a new university so I could be closer to her). I think its ridiculous that she doesn't recognize her own feelings, and every day it hurts more to think about.

&#x200B;

I know there probably isn't more advice than what I've already said I'm doing, but I would really appreciate any more additional insight. I'm really having a hard time coping at this point and I've never been more miserable. I opened up and was vulnerable to her and she immediately gave up on me as soon as things became complicated. I really thought I deserved another chance. When she wanted another chance, I gave it to her without a second thought. I really thought I deserved the same but she has since said my feelings don't matter to her and she only cares about how she feels.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm set to move on about 2-3 weeks (before the holidays). I was going to transition by staying at the place she is staying at (her friend's house) but now I've told her friend I'm unsure if I can see her. I really don't know what to do anymore. I think I might go ahead and stay at her friend's house for a brief time, and maybe interacting with her in person will help remind her that she cares about me. I still truly believe we can overcome this but it just hurts so much. \[Sorry for the post not being super concise, I'm just very emotional.\]",relationship_advice

I've gone to my future FIL and explained the situation to him and his response was a mere ""she gets like this she is hard to control"" but reassured me I can stay on the property.

Unfortunately his ex talked to him a few days prior so his current gf freaked out a bit but he then explained it was nothing.

We he told me that I was shocked that she had his security code. And he casually told me ""no I think it's normal, I understand her, I have nothing to hide, if you love someone you don't keep anything secret"". My other guy friend agreed with him.

Now me I'm a firm believer of privacy, and even if yes you share a lot with your SO (with my ex-gf I shared every emotions or thoughts or concerns I had), I think it's totally normal that some stuff can stay private (for exemple I hate telling people how much money I have or what do I do with it).

My 11 year old sister is really mean to me and has been doing it for ~a year. I’m 19 and I live at home since my economical and health situation isn’t suitable for living alone. I’m chronically physically ill and I suffer from anxiety and my triggers are mostly loud noises and lights. I’m also suffering from ongoing fatigue and I’m too tired to deal with a screaming 11 year old. 

My sister screams at me, calls me mean things (well, as mean as an 11 year old can be), steals my things (my airpods, makeup...), destroys my things (pencils, cosmetica, electronics, clothing), won’t clean up after herself, etc. My parents hope it’s going to end soon since ’it’s just a phase’. I never scream at her or anything, since I did it once and my parents got really mad at me and threatened to stop paying for my school. 

When I was a kid our parents would be very strict with me, but with my sister they won’t do anything to stop her bad behaviour. She wanted a dog, we got a dog and now she won’t go out with him or feed him. Our parents work a lot so they don’t have time to take care of the dog. Sooo the dog-caring falls on me. I’m really sick and sometime’s I can’t leave the house for days on end, so I really CAN’T take care of a dog and our parents know it. They even said I don’t have to care for the dog before we got him since ’your sister is going to care for him’. Now we have a understimulated dog who destroys everying in his sight because he’s bored. 

My sister knows my triggers and she’s destroying my life by playing music loudly when she could be wearing headphones, sometime’s she just rushes into my room to harass me while her friends are on facetime, she calls me retarded (not really bad in itself but I am really sick so it hurts hearing it). Her stealing my things is one of the most annoying things since I’ve paid for those myself, and I can’t afford to buy new ones since she usually loses/destroys my stuff. 

I’m really tired of not having peace at home since that should be the place where I can sleep and rest, but it’s hard when a pre-teen is making my life harder than it already is. I cry every day because I’m so tired of this situation.

382,e6jxot,throwsawsyhvvgh,1575564900.0,24,"I made jokes about my hometown in my standup comedy routine, it's causing problems for my family back home","I am 28f and I got into standup as a hobby this year. Trying to cure myself off my public speaking fear, trial by fire style. It's been challenging but also a lot of fun, and there's a great community around it.

You've probably heard a lot of comedy comes from a place of sadness, having to be able to laugh about or mock bad shit that's gone on in your life. 

When I started with stand up I had trouble using stuff that was personal to me in my material, I was scared to open up that much. But over time I found that the personal honest stuff landed best.

And I've got plenty of personal shit to poke fun at; I grew up in an ass-backwards small town, turned out to be gay as hell, heard all the bullshit that came with that. Got into college to escape all that, and somehow landed a job as an engineer for what might be the world's most corrupt company. Like, wreck three luxury cars in the customer's dime and keep your job, kind of corrupt. Then somehow end up on the other side of the country, running from my problems, again, only stopping to stand in front of a group of drunk strangers to seek validation for a few minutes.

So I play up the absurdities of my life. Like the shit people said to me in my old town about my sexuality that's so cruel and misinformed it's funny.

Or the absolute characters I worked with in my first job. 

Anyway, once I added a bunch of material about my own life, like the crazy ""you can't make this shit up"" kind of stuff, way more of my jokes were landing. 

Then, sometime recently, one of my sets ended up on YouTube. It was one where I just tore into my hometown, all I had to do was say a lot of shit people actually said to me and I was getting laughs. 

And then I found out that some people from my town saw it, saw that I was 1000% playing up the homophobic, ass-backwards, hick, etc... Aspects of my town. Then someone posted it on the community Facebook group (or so I've heard, I'm not on it) with some disapproving comments.

And that got back to my parents, people are looking unkindly at them for having a daughter who would say all that shit so publicly, make the town look like an absolute trash heap when it's a place they love.And I feel bad, my parents are great people. 

One of my old friends from high school, who I'd kind of lost touch with since, messaged me to say it was really low of me to exaggerate every bad thing about the town. She knew I'd had rough times, but If also had a lot of good times, and some really good friends. And dissing the whole town like it's got nothing good about it at all is disrespectful of where we came from.

I felt kind of bad about that, and also kind of bad about the lack of nuance I'd used. Like some of the people who've said really awful stuff as kids have grown an me changed since. Some of the older people who've said awful stuff are dead now and maybe that should be off limits.

TLDR - Can I have some advice on how to handle it after my standup annoyed and pissed off some people from my hometown?",relationship_advice

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csgyjh/my_girlfriend_of_3_years_broke_up_with_me/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Anyway I'm doing better now, made some friends, got a job, lost 40lbs, learning how to cook.

Me and my ex talk on the regular, I would say every other night give or take. We are still friends really good friends. She tells me some of the things her new boyfriend is doing.

She has started doing drugs because her boyfriend and his sister have access to drugs. Subsequently she has been failing some of her classes and quit her job.

I'm not saying the drugs made her do it, I'm just saying that he isnt a good influence on her. He also has done some borderline abusive things. He gets angry at her for inconsequential reasons and when she stands up for herself and threatens to walk away he does a 180 and apologizes. Sometimes she calls me crying because he has been such an asshole

So here is my deliema.

I have been rather reluctant to give her my opinion. I want to tell her that hes a piece of shit and she should stand up for herself, furthermore to quit the drinking and doing drugs.

However

A). She just moved to a new state and met him there, they are her only friends so I dont know if she would even consider the idea of walking away

B) Most significantly I dont want to tell her these things because no matter how I say it I think I'll come across as, ""oh break up with your boyfriend""

Anyway, should I just let her figure it out on her own? Or should I make an attempt to keep her grounded and out of what I perceive at least to be a bad situation?",relationship_advice
384,e6jx0n,jrich9328,1575564822.0,1,Am I a awful or is my boyfriend just overreacting?,"Hey guys, I really need an outsider perspective here because according to my boyfriend of over a year, I'm absolutely awful now. This is what happened-

My boyfriend and I are currently staying in my parent's basement to beef up funds, we both just got back from huge trips and are trying to travel more and renovate a trailer. I honestly hate living with my parents, I know we're doing it for a good purpose and it's only for a few months but I'm 26 and it's a little rough. The other night I got home(boyfriend was still at work) and my parents were having a huge fight, which then lead to me fighting with them and a whole slew of BS that made me feel like I was in High School again and I wasn't the happiest. I told my boyfriend what was up with the fighting and vented a bit, and then because of that texted him ""I might need space tonight"". He just said okay. He works at a music studio he actually used to live at, and he's slept on the couch there before, it's a nice little setup.

Then he called me and was clearly cranky, and the convo went like this

""I just need to know what's happening."" (him)

""Well what's your schedule like tomorrow?""(me)

""I have to wake up balls early and be right back here at the studio to work again""(him)

""Oh well why don't you just stay there, I'll stay here, and we can reconvene. Some space might do us both good."" (me)

""OK Miss Self Absorbed"" Hangs up on me.

I was already in fighting mode and I did send him a text after that saying ""Seriously, I'm self absorbed because I need a night? Stop being so codependent!"" So yeah, I was a bitch.

Next thing I know though my boyfriend comes home the next day, moves all of his stuff out of the basement without even speaking to me, and when I asked him why he flipped and says that he's never had anyone do anything so shitty to him. He says I should have known he wanted to come home, apparently he had a photoshoot the next day he needed a shower for and he looked like shit for his photoshoot so of course he blamed me(he didn't tell me this though), and he says he can't depend or rely on me. He says I'm not the type of partner he wants, I don't know how to be in a partnership, I cast him aside, I'm selfish, I abandoned him, blah blah blah.  He's mad that I didn't ""ask for space"" I just ""told him I need space"". I'll give him the fact that I was selfish-I was pretty upset with my family stuff and I didn't honestly consider him to the full extent, but if he had even protested once or told me about his photoshoot I would have told him to come home. He's told all of his friends that ""I didn't let him come home"". He says me needing space and how I handled it is a symbol and a large indicator that I don't actually want a life with him or want a partnership with him, I just like the idea of a relationship.

Ok, sorry, this is alot. But basically...I think he's being crazy, way overreactive, insecure, and personally I think space is okay even if you're living together(this is literally the first time in a year I've asked for it!). He thinks I'm a huge bitch even more because of that and thinks my morals are skewed, and refuses to forgive me unless I really see the err of my ways. Am I really a big bitch here? Was it that big of a deal? Or is he being crazy...? Help.

TLDR; I ask boyfriend for night alone at parents house where we're staying because of a family fight, my boyfriend freaks out on me and says I'm a selfish awful person and that I didn't let him come home.

&#x200B;

Edit: I've literally had other dudes do this to me in the past and I never batted an eyelash. I'd be out at a friends, they would call and say they were having a rough night and needed a night alone, I would find a couch to crash on...and he's also spent the night in his studio many many times, I didn't think this was such a bad thing...I feel awful, damn.",relationship_advice
385,e6juoq,blondegirlbigworld,1575564550.0,3,Do you believe in gut feelings? Gut- visions? BF abuse?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

So I have been in an on and off relationship since my first year of college (20 F) with a man at the college nearby (21 M.) Things have been tumultuous so say the least, we've both been caught in lies, disloyalty, et cetera. But somehow, we are always drawn to one another like magnets. He hasn't betrayed me in almost half a year. I think his loyalty has changed, I know he loves me. He projects childhood issues onto me, comparing me to his father when angered. A few weeks ago we got in a  fight over something trivial (who would pay for an uber) and he ended up pushing me around and punching the wall near my head. I left him.

&#x200B;

We started texting again around 5 days ago. Catching up, had really missed one another. Last night he came over in person to talk, and he had a lengthy apology on why he would never do it again, why he knew he was wrong, even tears. But for some reason, every ounce of my being was insisting every word he spew was a lie, and I had a bad gut feeling. When I brought up that I was afraid it was the wall this time, and my face the next he said he completely understood why I felt that way, and that he understands why I would be scared. I dunno if I was just high (420) or what the heck, but I kept imagining him trying to kill me. Or attacking me, Or beating me. Like vividly seeing it in my mind while he was speaking. I thought about grabbing the scissors and screaming at him to get the fuck out. I was so scared in my mind. I don't know if that's even reasonable - like should you trust gut feelings, gut vision? or was I just tripping? He even started talking to me like I was his girlfriend, and when i reminded him I wasn't, he was like oh well sorry its just hard not tot think of you that way haha. 

I got water and calmed down. He ended up spending the night, we had sex, he held me, etc. But I can't stop thinking about the way I felt in that moment. It certainly isn't healthy, but it is justifiable? I asked him if he ever had bad gut feelings about me and he said sometimes but we shouldn't listen to those silly voices and let them control our life. Makes sense. But I can't shake that feeling.

&#x200B;

He's publicly roasted me on his insta story when we've broken up. Punched the wall. Pushed me around. I just am fearful, I dunno about the visions though. That's never really happened to me. Is that a thing?

386,e6ju42,ThrowRAdone123,1575564484.0,1,"Girlfriend of 5.5 years split, house together, & counseling - help needed","Throwaway obviously.

I \[M28\] have been with my girlfriend \[F26\] for 5.5 years.  Have things always been perfect?  Absolutely not.  Are there things I could have done differently?  Of course.  I am trying to make my way through this as we've been together for so long I cannot fathom a life without her.  We still love each other, but last Saturday she came to me saying that she wants to sell our house (which is something I'm very proud of) and doesn't want to be together anymore.  There's never been any hot topic issues with our relationship like infidelity, abuse, drug addiction, etc.

I work very hard to provide for us and pay more than the majority of the bills as I make more money and own my own business, which I have no problem doing, but I also find myself doing more and more around the house which makes me feel like I have done it all at times since my schedule is more flexible and she has a traditional 9-5.  Starting a business being the only employee has been 100 times more work than I ever imagined.  I feel underappreciated as a man and a provider to us.  I also have not appreciated her like I should or put her needs before mine.  Both are at fault for sure.

I'm at a point where the business is doing great, I will hire my own employee next year, and I'm going to have my life back.  I'm going to have more time for her and I and to work on our relationship and that's always been the plan to propose, travel, etc. so to have all of this happen when I'm so close to making my plans happen is just a punch in the face.  I started in in 2016 with nothing, it's been wildly successful, we've had to move locations, expand, and more just to keep up with the growth.  I'm lucky to have this and glad I took the chance, but she's been there since day 1 which is why this hurts so much.  It feels like it's ours, not just mine.

We have had some toxic patterns and have fought unfairly for awhile now like saying things that have nothing to do with the topic at hand and things just escalate out of control and we use our deepest secrets against each other.  It's just building up resentment on both of our ends.  She's told me in the past that she's lonely, or isn't happy...and I honestly took it as her blowing smoke as she's done in the past because how could anyone be unhappy with all I'm providing for us?  Bad attitude, I know and I regret not listening sooner.  She told me that she was completely done, but I suggested counseling as a last ditch effort, which is tomorrow.   I don't know what to expect about it as it seems like I'm dragging her there and she's already made up her mind.  She's suggested it before, but there's saying something and then actually taking action like I am doing scheduling an appointment and just saying show up please.  

She said ""I'll go but don't expect it to change my mind"" so I'm really hoping we make some profound progress tomorrow and realize we love each other, we've just been bad to each other.  I'm not very religious, but I've been praying lately for the first time in my life.  I'm just begging her at this point not to put the nail in the coffin or cut that last thread and to not give up hope on us.

I have been worried sick all week and it doesn't seem like she wants to change her tune.  We have a house that not many people our age can afford (both mid 20s) in a $325,000 first time home.  We have 4 beautiful dogs, two are mine and two are hers...I obviously love them all like my own, but I can't even imagine a day where we don't have them all together.  Or a day when her and I are complete strangers.  5.5 years is a long time and I'm so proud of how we've grown up together and all we have.

I don't want this to end, I want to be better, but it doesn't seem like she can look past our issues and isn't willing to do that.  She's sleeping on the other side of our house, she just doesn't care and seems checked out.  She says she's ""tried"" to be happy for so long and make things work, but are you really trying and putting in effort if you allow yourself to get thrown right back into a toxic pattern?  To me, it's not worth it to throw everything away.  Right now, I don't even see her for her faults or our past fights.  I see the girl I love.  I have no idea what to expect with counseling.  I'm not expecting a Hail Mary, but I'm hoping to get some clarity either way.

Has anyone ever been to couple's counseling and can I expect anything to get better or just cut my losses and move on?",relationship_advice
387,e6jscw,abhundred,1575564275.0,10,Fiance dislikes close family friends and is not wiling to compromise,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

 So me (M25) and my fiance(F24) are getting married in May.  Let me first say that sine being in a relationship with her (almost 3 years) I've never given her a reason not to trust me. I've been loyal and faithful in every aspect to her, so I'm not sure why she is the way she is. In preparations for our wedding, the issue has arisen that she doesn't want to support a family friend on my side of the family with her (Lucy) business. 

She decorates and preps event halls (she does a very good job), nor does she want to invite Lucy to our wedding. Lucy has supported our business (Small retail store) since we opened. So I figure it only right to give her our business as well.

The reason is that she does not like being around her family. Lucy has teenage kids which I took under my wing and gave them advice on HS & college as somewhat of an older brother role model (this was before I meet my fiance). Mind you Lucy at one point I was getting to know Lucy's sister (Karla 26), which didn't work out (only went out on 2/3 dates). Karla now has a family and we go on about our lives as if nothing ever happened (since it's the truth). 

The issues became apparent when I was in a severe motorcycle accident where I was hospitalized and then bedside for a few months.

This is where Lucy and her family came often to check up on me and my family. Lucy's daughter now Nancy (19) was always very close to me so she would bring me gifts and always checked up on me. I never looked at her with any intent outside of a friend/brother's perspective. 

And I know she didn't either since he would ask me for advice regarding boys, etc. 

My fiance and I argued a lot about Nancy due to the close bond. Eventually, I decided to distance myself from Nancy and her family to avoid confrontation which I hate. I don't know what to do or how to get her to understand that Lucy's family are not just my friends but my parent's friends and they will be invited because it's the right thing to do.  

&#x200B;

Side note: I feel like an ass hole because of Lucy &Karla's father (Nancy's grandfather) was diagnosed with colon cancer and I have not gone to see him. All because I've wanted to avoid conflict with y fiance. I feel horrible because he visited me multiple times when I was recovering and tried to cheer me up. I was told a few days ago that it's getting worse and y conscious is eating me away. Its jut that my fiance gets very upset (angry & crying) whenever we discuss this type of thing. I try to compromise, but I feel as if she stands by her NO.

392,e6jnls,foregone87,1575563718.0,1,I (24M) dropped my phone in my GF's (22F) car and she went through everything?,"I'm in a fairly new relationship. It's been about 4 months. Things have been going well but my GF has serious insecurity issues. These started while we were studying in the library at school. We share a small booth and we both work out of our laptops. I noticed when I had facebook open, a female friend who I've talked about before, and known since I was 13 years old, messaged me ""Hey, how was your midterm?!"" and I responded (not attempting to hide anything because I didn't think I was doing anything wrong) ""It went well, I got a B, but the curve rose it to an A!"" After a couple minutes I looked over and my GF was in tears. We ended up having to go outside of the library and talk for 2 hours about it. She didn't like that another female was messaging me. This was incredibly mentally draining, but I like this girl so I just dealt with it at the time.

She also jokes in a way that makes me uncomfortable in situations I have no control over. For instance, a cashier at Target asked about my shirt, and she assumed that the cashier was hitting on me and got upset with me after. I also confronted her about the constant jealousy, and she told me ""I don't think you've ever cheated on me, but if you ever do I'll break up with you fast."" (which was odd). 

Well, the constant jealousy has been annoying, but I feel like when we're not in that mode we have a good time and genuinely enjoy out time around each other. Which brings me to the purpose of this post. We went on a date. She was driving this time around. I had my phone in my lap, and I guess when I got out of her car it fell out of my lap into her seat and she drove back home. I didn't notice until she was gone and I was inside my house. I messaged her on facebook and she told me she could bring my phone to me. She lives 30 minutes away so I told her I'd just ""get it from her tomorrow at school."" Well, about 2 hours later I get a message on facebook from her saying ""Do you really like me?""

After a bit of prying into this she said ""my phone lit up and she went to turn it off, and opened it up and it opened up and it automatically went to a text conversation with a women"" which I am 99.9999999% sure is a lie because it was a really old conversation. This prompted her to do a complete forensic analysis of my phone. The conversation ""with a woman"" was from before I ever started dating my current GF, and it was a woman I dated a bit before and just never deleted the conversation because I never saw any reason to, and I like to keep chats like that for my records if I can. She did a facebook call to me so we could talk that night and went through all the messages on my phone that bothered her, mostly from before we ever dated. Nothing in my phone from the time I started dating her was inappropriate (except in her mind any interaction with the opposite sex is inappropriate, so even non-sexually charged conversation of 'hey how have you been?' - 'good and you?' is inappropriate). 

Bottom line is I feel incredibly violated. All of my privacy. I don't know what all she saw but I have really personal conversations and I'm a very personal person. I don't like talking on the phone in front of others, and I don't like sharing my conversations even if it's simply ""hey how's it going?"".. I also don't like when I'm talking to someone and they have me on speakerphone in the presence of others. I'm really shy about that. 

I don't know what to do. I like this girl but I don't know if I can get over her insecurities. I don't think she can either.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

Overly jealous girlfriend coincidentally ended up with my phone in her possession, I trusted her to keep it overnight and bring it to me the next day and she broke that trust and went through every trace of my phone. Messages, call history, facebook messages, hangouts messages, whatsapp messages and Line messages. Wouldn't be surprised if she went through my emails either. She found nothing to indicate unfaithfulness but still made a big deal about things that happened long before we ever dated (no infidelities. Just conversations). I feel violated, but still like her and dont necessarily want to end things.",relationship_advice

Please read these with the context that in general we are great together, we love the same activities, make each other laugh, treat each other very well, etc.

1. Is it normal to feel bored at times when you've been with someone for more than 6 years? Is it ok as long as the phases of boredom don't become the norm? 

--to add to this, in the first 4 years I NEVER even looked at anyone else, but now I find myself getting little gym crushes and wondering what it would be like to date cute guys I see. (but I would NEVER cheat)

2. He has not thought deeply about whether or not he wants to marry me. He's never signaled that he would break up with me, never been disloyal in any way. He seems just content with how things are. Sometimes I'm cool with this because I'm in no rush to be married either, but sometimes I feel this could be a major red flag. I can't afford to be dumped in a few years when I'm 30 and start all over. It hurts that he hasn't put some deep thought into this by now.

3. Our sex has lost the intense passion and excitement that was there in the early years. It's still great sex (both parties get off every time) but I guess if I am committed to him forever, I will never have that kind of sex again since it seems to be long gone. Idk if I will be ok with this loss 10 years down the road? If he makes me happy all around, is this something normal people would just accept?

4. He doesn't put in his fair share of work when it comes to keeping the house in order. Is it fair or unfair of me to translate this to how he might be with kids? Sometime I think I will end up doing all the work for our childcare, but he does take great care of his dog so is this an unfair assumption for me to make?

396,e6jm4b,AnnShKa,1575563547.0,1,My (18f) family is trying to regain contact with me after saying my dad left enough money for me to attend college for 4 years,"* Sorry for the format and any grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language 

First off, I should clarify that by family I mean my dad's siblings with whom I've had no contact for almost a year after they went out of their way to steal my dad's ashes, electronics (were he kept letters that he had written for me ever since he found out my mom was pregnant), legal paperwork and money.
My dad passed away after six years of dealing with stage iv cancer, he was an amazing person but he craved his family's attention and after years of being pumped with hormones he had definitely changed.

Before moving to where I'm currently at, near two of his siblings, my relationship with his entire family was actually good, I didn't see them often but I enjoyed seeing them for the most part. The only thing I never liked was the way they treated my mom, she's an amazing person and the only reason I'm alive, she endured years of them treating her like a terrible person an mother but she never sayd a single thing to me growing up, she let me form my own opinion and when I finally cut any ties I had with them she told me everything.

When my dad passed, my mom used all of her retirement money to keep me here, I was still in high school and she could have forced me to go back to my country but she let me make the decision myself. A couple months ago we were in a terrible economic situation, neither one of us had any money left (no money for food or to pay bills) and both my siblings helped us overcome it. I had to postpone going to college, end my housing contract and find somewhere else to live, it was an awful time for both of us (she had gone back to my country to start the paperwork) but I had never felt so alone. It's been a couple of months and I'm better, both physically and mentally, I started working and organizing my life, but I still can't afford to go to a public college for the next semester. 

Thing is my dad's family found out about everything my mom and I went through and reached out via one of my dad's friends saying my dad left enough money for me to attend college for 4 years, they said they wanted to talk to me (not my mom, who they despise) and although I need the money and I know it's legally mine and my mom's, no one in my immediate family wants me to have any contact with them. My mom wants to be clear with them and tell them that I want no contact, which is true, and everything money related they have to talk to her; what my mom is doing is shielding me from reliving my last two years, and keeping my number and address out of their reach. Most likely they want to keep tabs on me by sending me that money little by little, and to have an excuse to try and 'fix' our relationship (I have to say both me and my mom have always been money-responsible, I work and can pay rent and food with my paycheck so that money would fulfill my dad's intended purpose). 

There is nothing to fix with them, they mentally abused me, threatened me with physical abuse, threatened my pregnant sister and my mother and blatantly lied about everything to everyone else to justify their need for control over my life. They traumatized me and made me fear going anywhere, just because I'm afraid of running into them and all the progress I've made being wiped out, and I know that's what my family fears as well. 

I don't want to sound too shallow or money centered, but ever since I went through not having a single penny I'm afraid of not having the money to pay for my essentials, and as much as I know I could get a loan, that money is me and my mom's. 

This is mostly a rant because I don't know what to do, I don't think they'll agree to my mom's terms but I want to start college and I know I can't afford it myself or I'll go into an enormous debt.",relationship_advice
397,e6jlrn,MagnoliaBlossomm,1575563505.0,19,My (20F) boyfriend (26M) can be an air head and I’m sick of getting annoyed by it,"Lately it seems like he’s been living in this other world and I’m trying so hard not to take it personally.

I’d told him a month, two weeks, a week and a few days before my cousin’s graduation speech. He’s very last minute about things, especially when he has no interest in them. So the speech and funeral are on the same day but if we grow past our feelings and plan it out I could be there for him and for my cousin easy. But somehow after my reminders, and suggestion to take two cars he nearly breaks down saying he wants to be with me in one car so I let him drive. Of course the funeral is going longer and I gently remind him that I need to go soon. He asks me, “why?” And I tell him for the fifth time about the speech. Long story short I had to miss it.

He’ll forget my schedule even though I text him what it is, my work phone number so he can’t make the excuse that he doesn’t know it, family events, what I ask him to grab from the store. I’m starting to think he just doesn’t care.

We recently went to his sister’s baby shower. It was 90% their family, 5% the dad’s family and 5% coworkers that I know. I can’t tell you how many times he just left me in a crowd of people I barely know. He didn’t include me in conversation and I had to fight to feel included with him. At one point I would just go and sit back down and he’d be looking left and right trying to find me. Like yes, I’m still here. Did you forget?

The other night we were on the phone before bed. I’d taken a short nap prior and was telling him I had a nightmare. His response was, “Oh. Well good night, I’m gonna go talk to my mom.” Like alright guess I’ll be cool on my own. Don’t ask me to open up anymore since I’ll be fine by myself without you.

I don’t get to see him every day because of work and school so I really enjoy morning conversations because we mostly say good morning and then good night hours later during the work week. I ask him to call me and he says he will and then just doesn’t. Even if it’s for five minutes on his way to work but he can’t even bother.

No I didn’t answer my phone, I’m in class like I told you.

No I’m not not home yet, I have work tonight like I told you.

No we can’t do this, I picked up a shift this weekend, don’t you remember me telling you???

Is this normal behavior from men? I’ve never dated anyone who can just be so absent minded. He’s smart in every other regard but holy shit everyday I’m so annoyed with him. He has plenty to stress over but I remember stuff because I go out of my way to write them down. Even if it’s his stuff, he’s still important to me.

I (25f) love my fiance (27m) more than ever. He has always had a massive issue with heart burn. Anything he ate would give him heartburn and would make him wanna throw up or cough uncontrollably. He recently got benefits from his new job and was able to get medication that cured his hurt burn. The problem? He has been eating EVERYTHING he couldnt eat before and then some. I understand hes so use to monitoring what he eats and now he has freedom but its gotten outta hand.

This guy is my best friend. Obviouslyyyyy i have spoken to him about this. Everytime i bring it up (gently) he says hell start working out then never does. He himself has even said that his face is getting fatter and he feels fat in places hes bever felt before. Its ironic because when we first started dating we literally promised each other we would tell one another if the other was getting fat. I have even offered to go to the gym with him on numerous occasians (theres a gym in our condo). To make matters worse he saw my family about two months ago and during that time my family had privately told me that he has gained a lot of weight. And hes gained 10 lbs since then!!! We have a xmas dinner on dec 28 and as bad as it sounds i really dont want him to come because of the judgment my family will make. He is making zero effort to even try to lose weight, instead he keeps blaming the dryer for his clothes getting smaller. 

Obviously i love this guy but he keeps having nothing but excuses. He says “ooh ur acting like im 600 pounds.” Well the 600 lbs guy was once 180. Just to be clear i perfer men that have meat on them. He was 170 until he started putting on the weight now hes about 205. I just dont know what to do about this christmas party since he already knows when and wherre it is",relationship_advice

I met this girl through a friend in new york when I was on winter break, she is from the UK and I am from Texas. We started chatting and kept in touch. Eventually things escalated and we caught feelings, we proceeded to visit each other repeatedly for the rest of the year.  She got drunk and made out with people in a club but she apologized profusely and I forgot about it. 

We were now ""Dating"". As the summer started we organized a trip to Canada and had the best time of our lives. 

The next Semester started and we both had a heavier course load and could not visit each other as our schedules did not line up at all so we continued with facetime throughout the year. I thought all was well. 

Eventually summer came around and she saw me take the picture of a friend for her instagram and like it, she said she was jealous and this was cheating and proceeded to break up with me. 

Throughout the summer we continued to talk, and we both wanted to get back together but I decided to let things work out on their own. We flirted a bit all summer and I would get drunk calls to get back together. 

&#x200B;

As the semester started I focused on my grades, as I was applying for internships and had to focus and practice for the interviews, but I kept in touch with my ex. As the semester continued I missed her more and more and kept talking to her. A month before thanksgiving break we were flirting pretty heavily, as well as talking about getting back together and I bought tickets to visit her over break as a surprise, a day after I bought tickets I saw her story on instagram with another guy and she told me she fucked the dude and every single detail of their night, I felt disgusting. I cancelled the tickets and asked her why she would lead me on telling me to visit if she was going to fuck this other dude a month before I had planned to visit, she then told me it was a mistake and she shouldn't have fucked this dude because it caused her a relationship and she had no feelings and it was just a rebound and mistake. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, being the stupid man that I am I talked her through the whole thing to stop talking with this other dude and told her I was going to stay away, when she told me she bought me a ticket to visit her. So, alas I visit her for thanksgiving break and have a great time but I cant get the thought of her with the other dude out of my head, even if we weren't ""dating"" at the time it still feels wrong.

Her parents think we are back together but I don't know what we are and don't know how to proceed.

I really like this girl but I have a lot of schoolwork and internships lined up, and it would be until the summer when either of us can visit and I don't know if I can go back to trusting her around her ""friends"".

He slammed on the breaks to ""teach them a lesson"". The other driver was SO close to hitting us. I was terrified because I never think it's worth it to do harm to yourself to teach someone a lesson. He did apologize for it and realized his mistake after but husband was in such a fury he didn't consider the consequences. This has put me on edge driving with him lately. 

Well now a couple days ago we were driving during rush hour. My husband had a small chance to change lanes. My husband was set up to politely change lanes and had his signal on BUT the guy behind him decided they were the one who needed to change lanes and whipped so fast from behind us and nearly hit us. My husband was so furious that he went as fast as he could, mind you it was rush hour so we could only go like 20km/h, to get behind this guy and ride his ass. A bit panicky after almost being hit (it would have been the passenger side) I asked him to stop being aggressive to this driver. He kept pushing it by driving as close as he could to the other car while the bad driver was break checking us. We are broke right now and can not afford to hit someone. Also, clearly this other driver is a dick and who knows his anger levels are like and if he will lash out on us. But my husband insists he needs to ""punish"" this guy but riding his tail. Since he won't stop I angrily say ""STOP IT"". Husband stopped but was furious that I was furious because he thinks he has every right to be driving ""aggressively"", especially when people wrong him. 

We have been fighting about this for days now because he thinks he needs to drive aggressively (his words) which is how he translates ""defensively"". He says he will not stop driving aggressively and says he feels more unsafe driving with me because I am a more cautious driver. I don't know what to do or even say to him. 

What do it do? He will not BELIEVE me when I tell him I feel unsafe when he is angry driving.

Am I wrong to think aggressive driving is dangerous and it only causes you harm to ""teach people lessons"" on the road? Or is it more dangerous to be cautious?",relationship_advice

I'm an introvert, perhaps emotionally dysfunctional, probably best to describe as being a bit broken up there. I am a good person, not an outcast but I'm not 'included' simply because I don't get involved. I have no feeling that I need to go out and make friends, so I don't really bother, I'm content as I am but I wonder if my lack of a need to be social has stunted my social and emotional development a tad.

I don't have anyone who I'd be able to call if my car broke down to ask for a lift, for example.

I work too much, partly self inflicted but with good intentions.

My work has always been busy and stressful, really stressful, to the point where I nearly had a nervous breakdown several years ago, I was really ill for a while and the doctors were testing for all sorts like crohns disease and got alopecia too, this was all triggered by work stress, becoming a Dad and three family members passing away - all within 12 months. Those were dark times. Pulling through that work remained mostly the same, levels of stress which looking back I'm baffled as to why I suffered though it instead of quitting.

One reason for not quitting was needing to provide for my family, paying the rent, paying the bills, treading water on a deep dark sea of debt. I'd managed to secure a good pay rise and reasonable bonus package, in a house hold with two incomes or no dependants it would have been comfortable. In a single income family house hold with many expenses it was a different story. Another reason was always living under the dark cloud of stress, it ruined any feeling of self worth, I couldn't see that things would be any better anywhere else. I couldn't risk job hopping and ending up on a lower income, employment for my particular skill set is quite limited, and often far spread. 

Because I saw no way out I decided to try and make a way out by starting my own business, for the last few years I've been working full time, growing my small e-commerce business and trying to be a partner and father... and failing as I've now come to realise.

I eventually moved jobs and now commute 75 miles a day, nearly 2 hours, the money is better but the commute is expensive in fuel and also means I'm away from home an extra hour a day. This year has been stressful again due to some other issues at work (now resolved) and my own business picking up a bit. With commuting and my own work I put in 12-13 hours a day plus what ever I need to do on weekends, and have been for a good 3 years straight, I struggle with turning off and getting down times. 

My partner is also self employed and has been growing her own business over the years to the point it's now established and she pretty much fills all her free time in the day working plus a few evenings in the week once I'm home from work. She has worked so hard and continues to do so, not only at her job but also being a Mum. She's an amazing Mum, caring, considerate, compassionate, thoughtful, kind, selfless and so much more.

For years a small feeling has been there, that I don't truly love her. Initial infatuation which faded, rather than true love? With so much going on it was easy to dismiss those small persistent but increasing feelings as being due to stress, fatigue, exhaustion sometimes, a bad day at work, another bad night sleep.

I've managed to get back on top of the enormous sleep deficit which had built up over the early years of being a parent and working late in to the night, my own business has plateaued and my day job has eased off a touch so the stress levels I've endured for a decade have eased. Suddenly I've found myself thinking more clearly and thoroughly about everything, and I've realised I've screwed up badly. I've brought a child in to this world in a relationship where I once thought I loved, but now know I don't, then strung it out so long I've wasted what should have been the best years of an amazing woman's life. I've hurt her time and time again, not physically, but mentally and emotionally, by being a miserable, grumpy, rude bastard; never intentionally but always knowingly. Aware of how I was being but unable to change what I had become. She was always there for me, no matter what, unconditional despite my ungrateful dismissive behaviour.

We have a truly amazing daughter, she has all her mothers kindness, caring and creativity and my quick humour, stubborn nature and attention to detail. She is everything to me, writing this whole thing, the only time I'm welling up is writing this right now about my daughter. We bicker like siblings, then in a moment we are laughing out loud at each other for being goofy. Every night I do shower and bedtime story, it's hard when I'm tired, I struggle not to be impatient with her when she excited to see me and just wants to mess around and play, I hate that about myself. The time we spend together is precious to me however, I cherish it, I look forward it.

She is all I ever hoped for when thinking what it would be like to be a Dad, there really aren't enough words to explain how that little human being makes me feel. She doesn't even know it but she's the reason I keep going, keep pushing forwards.

How do I tell my 7 year old daughter that she is my world, my everything, but that I don't love Mummy anymore, and so, have to move out? 

How will me moving out affect my daughter? How do I reassure her I'm not abandoning her, that I will always be there for here and be with her as often as possible? She already knows something is up, despite best efforts there is tension in the air and a bit of an atmosphere, I'm trying hard to be normal but (ex?)partner is struggling. I'm scared this could ruin her childhood, my parents divorced when I was 6, my step dad was awful. I feel like I'm about to induce a situation which I swore to myself I'd never put a child of mine in to ... but I can't stay in a relationship with someone I am no longer attracted to and no longer love, someone I have no feelings for anymore.

We're holding it together at the moment to get through Christmas, to make sure we have one last family time together, we can't take that away from our daughter but it will be tough going through such a difficult process. I don't know how to deal with or how to help with the anger and upset my partner is feeling, we're still living together which is making it really hard for her. I'm being as reassuring as possible, making clear my intentions for making things as easy as possible post separation, like how I'm going to be around loads, financial support, trying to be positive, kind, calm and none confrontational, etc.

Once Christmas and new year is out the way then I'll be moving out as soon as I can find somewhere to go, I'm planning to stay locally so I can see my daughter as much as possible, probably straight to her after work and continue doing the bedtime routine which will allow Mum to continue taking evening bookings for work if available. If I can get a place close to where my daughter will go to secondary school then it may be possible for her to stay with me more often once she's older and for Mum to stop by in the mornings when I've gone to work and take her to school? I've no idea how things will actually turn out, but I'm being as positive as possible as I want everything to work out well.

What else can I do to try and make this as smooth as possible, really not looking forward to the stress which is on the way.

I wish I could be so irresponsible and ignorant as to be able to make a comment like ""how did it end up like this"", unfortunately this is wholly my fault.",relationship_advice

My boyfriend has been diagnosed with combat PTSD and anxiety years back although in therapy they found most of his mental health problems are family related.  Been dating for 4 years and I noticed his personality recently changed.  I’ve seen this side of him, but only in short bursts, maybe a day or even an hour. But this cycle has been a month and it’s deeply upsetting to me as I lost the connection i used to have with him, i don’t even want to kiss him anymore as it doesn’t feel like him and i find myself being so short with him just so I can get away quicker because i feel like i cant stand him and i get creeped out.  He almost acts like a little kid.  Not with temper tantrums (which happens but that’s separate from this) but with the way he speaks and his mannerisms and his entire persona.  The things he does and says and the way he jokes are like hanging out with a 7 year old and he needs to be constantly reassured about everything and if i don’t give a big enough reaction he’ll say oh i guess you don’t find that interesting, or funny or whatever he’s trying to prove and get so so disappointed like i took his favorite toy away. Not normal behavior for him.  I’m holding on because I know the connection I had with the person I know, and if he had a broken arm i wouldn’t leave him if he needed help.  He is also not medicated, has had the same therapist for 2 years now.  I feel that enough isn’t being done, he doesn’t have an advocate to help him through this other than me really as he doesn’t feel comfortable sharing this with his family and friends.  Every day i hope it will be a better day and ill have my person back, it gets worse and worse and i feel nothing at this point.

418,e6j97f,ndic,1575562034.0,3,(18M) I Miss my Ex (17F) Suddenly After a Year?,"We broke up about a year ago after our two year relationship. I was her ""first everything"" relationship wise. She was madly in love with me, and I knew it. I did love her very much, however I didn't put as much effort as she did. I wouldn't say I was a bad boyfriend, but I just wasn't as good of a partner as she was. This slowly got to her, and she would cry to me asking me if I loved her towards the end of the relationship. Eventually she got over me while we were dating, and broke up with me (she lied about the reason) and wanted to remain friends. I complied, although I was still extremely sad. However I found out she was ""talking"" to her best guy friend I had let her hang out with on multiple occasions when we were dating. This hurt me even more, and I immediately resorted to no contact. She got with her best friend, and is still dating him now. I was sad for about two months, before I moved on and started dating other girls, I haven't looked back until now. In this past year, I've went through about 6 girls now, and have been with my one currently for 4 months. I'm doing good for myself and I'm happy in my current relationship.

Recently, I met up with some old friends. My ex still talks to them regularly, that's why I stopped talking to them. They told me that she mentions me quite often. She usually says really negative things about me, or just tells stories. Nonetheless, she mentions me quite often. Her parents and I have kept in touch this whole time, texting maybe once or twice a month, however I haven't talked to my ex since the break up, nor have I really mentioned anything about her to any friends. Finding out about this has sort of triggered me though. I've thought about her constantly since I've found out. I feel like I didn't know what I had until I lost it. My life is completely different than it used to be, and it's all hitting me now. I honestly miss the way things used to be.

I really miss her and her family, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It's been a year and it's just now hitting me that I'll never have anything with her again. Initially in our relationship, I thought I already had a first love, however it's apparent to me now they she was my first love.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 2 years left me for her best friend. (My fault) I just found out that she still talks about me to our old friends. Usually always negative things. Upon finding this out, I haven't been able to get her out of my head. It's like I'm getting over her all over again. What's the reason for these conflicting thoughts? Why is she still talking about me a year later? I haven't really thought about her much at all until now.",relationship_advice

So I made a separate one just to take photos.

I also took nudes using that account. I'd take them for him but never end up sending them because of my self esteem. I've since deleted the account and one day, I told him about it. And I didn't expect him to take it this way at all but he got so upset, accusing me of sending men nudes using that account. He kept asking me why I deleted it and it wasn't enough to just say that I didn't want to use the account anymore.

I feel like he's projecting, because of his guilt for getting too touchy with a couple of strippers a while back and lying about it. 

I have no idea what to say to him. Cheating is not in my blood, I have no idea how someone can do that. And I don't know how he can assume that I'd do that to him. I'd first dump him before doing that lol.

It has been suggested that I should go to therapy because of lack of self esteem, low confidence, social anxiety,.... any number of things. My parents tried to get me to go in my youth and I refused at all. Now its come down to my wife is urging me to go, almost on an ultimatum.

I don't know I am scared to go and lay on a couch and talk about my mom and dad, or what ever, take my skin off to some stranger, who is going to ask me all sorts of questions that I don't have the answers to or don't feel comfortable talking about. I don't have some kind of checkered past, I was not abused, not molested, didn't have mommy or daddy issues, was not dropped on my head, or have some major learning disability. Does it really help to go and talk to some stranger who does not know me from anyone and has no reason to care other than I am paying them to care. There are things I know they will ask that I don't want to answer, not because I am hiding anything but because well I am a private person. 

Then there is the cost, I don't have insurance, and then there is the stigma of it, I don't want anyone to know I am going to talk to someone about my feelings. I don;t like to talk to people about things like that , not even my family. I just don't trust it I guess.

422,e6j657,throwRA5124,1575561692.0,2,She deleted some texts,"Long story as short as possible. My(24m) gf(25) lives in a shared home but she has her own room. I always felt uncomfortable with it but it’s her life and I wanted her to be safe and can afford it, I never said anything. However I had a weird suspicion about one of the men who lived there. He was a weird guy but also a dick.

She used to complain to me how he would bother her about tiny things around the house. She’d cry. She thought he was a total asshole. She avoided him during a period of time until she tried to be civil. 

However I felt like something else was happening. I did something awful, I looked through her phone at the conversations with him. I wasn’t happy. At first they were friendly as he’d invite her to the gym or have dinner downstairs. But they quickly turned to compliments to her. Later turned to things like “I want to see you tonignt” “I’m in bed, join me?” 3am texts saying “you awake?” “Goodmorning, did you sleep well? Coffee is down stairs if you want some.”. He’d said a kissy face or cry face when she wasn’t home. And more of these explicit things. The thing is, she never responded, and seemed to deflect sometimes. But I also considered the fact that shes isn’t the greatest texter and she’s slow to respond. So I felt like maybe she was with him those nights. I quickly looked at the texts, I know what I saw but i don’t know what else there was. I know it’s super convenient for someone to just up and go to the next room in the house without needing to respond.

I confronted her recently and asked her if he ever said these very specific things. She said no. We had a long talk about it and denied it. The next day at work she looks through her phone, finds them, deletes them. I see her that night and say I’m not satisfied let’s look at her phone together. Boom, texts are gone. We talk, I say there’s gaps, she lies and says this is everything, I say let’s restore the phone she says ok, but we didn’t because she has hundreds and hundreds of apps and not everything backs up. She went through some steps to do it and I stopped her because I know it’s inconvenient. 

The next day I admit I looked through her phone earlier and saw everything. We talked and I had to pry more and more info out of her about it. Her responses were obvious indications of lying until she admitted things. She said she tried ignoring things because she didn’t like them. She lived there and didn’t want confrontation. She hated those texts and it made her uncomfortable. **i do understand as a woman it’s hard to respond to these things especially in the same household to avoid confrontation. It’s scary. 
However I never understood why she lied and delete them. It made me feel like more happened. Finally she admitted to deleting and everything, from there her responses to my questions became more relaxed and instant, the dead gives aways of lying vanished.

The thing is, she led me to believe she was cheating. She was always infatuated with me and excited to see me. Take me to family trips. No red flags ever. But this has made me extremely uncomfortable. 

I feel 2 things about this: 1. She cheated. Wanted to delete the texts to delete evidence. And hope to move on and I’d never know. 2. It’s legitimately scary for her. She didn’t want to see them, didn’t want me to see them so I’d be pissed about her living there. 

One more thing, there was a clear point in time where his attitude shifted from trying to get with her to becoming an asshole house mate. So I’m not sure what prompted that. 

TLDR: girlfriend deleted some texts from a housemate that tried to get with her. She never responded to them in an accepting way but never rejected him. She lied about the texts and lied about deleting them until I said I saw them beforehand. 

I’d really like some input

Edit: not entirely understanding why’d she delete the messages and lie about the whole thing to be honest with you. It makes me think more happened.

I dated this guy for about 9 months and it had been 7 when my birthday came around. So for my birthday my ex boyfriend’s grandmother gave me this nice, two photo hinged frame with a couple pictures of my then boyfriend. The day after, I moved 700+ miles away because of college and two months after that I ended the relationship with him. He ended up making shady, near slanderous posts about me on the book of faces, leaving out my name because then it doesn’t make it that bad *eye roll,* and I blocked him on every form of social media and blocked his number. That night my roommate and I burned the photos. I ended up keeping the frame because I thought it was beautiful on its own and I could repurpose it. 

Now sixteen months later, I’m seeing this wonderful guy who’s leaving for the first semester of his co-op and I thought I had found a reason to repurpose that frame.  I didn’t think it was going to be a big deal (a frame’s a frame right?) until I started talking to my coworker about it. I had asked him what to do if my BF felt bad about how much I had spent on Christmas, I got him two other things aside from the frame, and was describing everything. When I had mentioned the frame I gave my coworker all the details of how the frame came into my possession and he made a face.

He said that it was unnecessarily risky especially if I was worried that my BF would want to talk about the cost of things. He also suggested I sell the frame gifted to me and use the money to buy a different frame, which I did think about but the frame I have is really pretty. 

I asked a couple other coworkers and I got mixed answers; a couple agreed with my first coworker that it was not the best idea, but others agreed with me in thinking a frame’s a frame.

We are much less codependent; however we still sleep in the same bed, we have great sex, we talk about everything, we spend most of our time with each other, and we’re best friends. We just don’t really need each other. Sounds great? But here’s the issue....

I am wanting to do anything I want without having to get her permission. It’s more of a theoretical desire than a practical one. I just don’t want to have to ask her permission for things that don’t have a direct impact on her.

On her side, she is willing to give up *almost* all control in relationship except for the most extreme things. She just refuses to give up final control over certain aspects of my behavior. 

She refuses to give up than need to permit, while I bristle at having to get permission. 

I’m free to do 99.99% of things without her permission. She just requires that I get her permission for 0.01% of things I want to do. The implication is because she can’t trust my judgment when it comes to that 0.01% of things. The implication is that I have a blind-spot and that she must be my “mother” in that realm. 

It’s silly that I object. In practice, it’s easy for me to get her permission. I just don’t like the *idea* of having to get permission. I’d like to change my thinking so I can accommodate her and so that I don’t have this internal rebellion. I feel like the angry teenager who is rebelling just to rebel. 

It’s as if she’s saying, “You can eat anything in the kitchen you want, just not the old moldy pickle.” I didn’t want to eat the pickle anyway, but now that she’s telling me I can’t, I’m frustrated and I want to eat it. 

How do I get over my frustration? If I tell her, she’s going to see it as me wanting to cut the final thread of what she defines as our marriage. I think she defines our marriage as controls, and I can’t force her to redefine it. I also don’t want to end the marriage. I want to change my thinking. How do I alter my thinking so that I’m not frustrated by her very minimal control?

He got into hard drugs, became an alcoholic, and used to physically and verbally abuse myself and my mom. She divorced him and left when I was really young. Growing up, I never saw my dad. I’d talk to him on the phone, I’d go to his parents’ house thinking that he would come to see me like he promised, and he never did. Now, at 22 years old, he texts me saying he wants to be in my life. Am I wrong for not wanting to respond to him? My mom remarried, and my stepdad has been all I could ever want in a father.

He met her while we were on a break but even when we got back together he keeps following and u following her and acting like a fan boy over her photos.  He claims he isn't doing anything wrong and kept bringing up the good things he did for me and that I don't love him. I carried it in me cause I was so afraid to bring it up.

That was actually 2 weeks ago, haven't seen her since. When she left that night she sent me a friend request right away so we texted for a bit but the next day. But the way she texts is opposite of how she acts in real life.

So I was best friend with this girl for a pretty long time and there have been some feelings surrounding our relationship. We kissed some times and had an on and off thing , but still remained best friends.


She got this bf after a while and everything went great between them until she decided that she has no feelings for him anymore and wants to try and see how a relationship between us would be.


She tells him, and he was pissed. She tells me that she will have to think about it because she doesn't know what to do. I don't pressure her, it's her decision after all. He said some mean stuff about me that I can't look past, said some mean stuff about her too, so she ultimately chose to be with me.


After maybe a week, our relationship wasn't the norm. We were still the best friends we were, only we kissed sometimes (we were kinda in the closet). And randomly she texts me and says that she got together with her bf again and she hopes that I am not mad at her. 


I swallow my tears, even though she cannot see me, and tell her that of course I am happy for her and understand her decision, but I dont want to see him again because of the things that he had said. She says she understands.


I am torn. I want to be her best friend, and I will be, but i am deeply hurt, even though I thought I wouldn't be. I dont know how to act or what to do and I dont even know what advice I'm looking for  I think I am looking for an opinion on what happend or shit like that.

Before him my dating life was very difficult and painful. I was in brief relationships that were either short and casual, or insensely emotionally/physically abusive. So being open with my feelings is uncharted territory, i am always preparing for heartache but hes never let me down.

We have been dating for around 8 months. He is super supportive, patient, and kind. He is always checking on me, helping me be more confident in life and artwork. And is super patient and attentive when my depression and physical health issues flare up. Ive met so many new people through him and have a lot of new friends.

 LThe only problem is that we both don't really show affection through words. We show it through physical affection, gifts, sex, and being there for eachother. I really want to tell him that i love him, but i am also extremely nervous. I have a lot of abandonment issues due to family/past relationships. And my anxiety is telling me that it would scare him away.

438,e6iv9i,BriMcN,1575560422.0,0,"I (28f) just found out my husband (28m) may have cheated before we got married, or at least definitely tried. I'm trying to figure out how upset I have the right to be considering the mistakes I've made in the past.","Leaving him isn't something I want to do, I know a lot of you are going to read this and probably think we're both shitty people, but we do love each other very much and are working through our issues. Things have been going well. 

So some back story. My husband (F) and I are recovering addicts. We've both spent some time in jail over the last year, but are sober now and doing well, both of us are in treatment. Last fall we got arrested together but I got out 2 months earlier than he did after doing 2 months. Right before this happened, he read a couple texts between our dealer that we were living with and I, where he was trying to get me to fuck him for drugs. I made good money and didnt even consider it, but I also didn't shut him down and let him think I might while constantly making excuses and dodging him. It sounds fucking stupid but I just didn't know how to handle it without causing issues with our dealer and didn't tell F because I knew he'd fly off the handle on our dealer and was worried about our living situation. It was fucking stupid, but clearly I wasn't making great decisions. Right before this, one of my best (male) friends admitted to having feelings for me and it caused a lot of issues between F and I because he felt that I didn't handle the situation well. He wanted me to cut him out completely but I didn't agree because my friend never came on to me and respected my relationship. Until he didn't, and then I did cut him out, but this was after the fact. 

While he was in jail, I started using again and hung out with the group of people that my friend and dealer hang out with. I did go against his wishes and broke his trust, but at the time justified it because I wasn't seeing the specific people he didn't want me to. I told him immediately and for a while after he got out, he understandably had a hard time trusting me. 

When we first got together, he lied to me about where he was going and hung  out with his ex. He turned off his phone and I couldn't reach him for hours. I was obviously worried so I logged in on his fb to try to get an idea of where he was. I wasn't snooping, at that point I was worried he had gotten high and overdosed or got arrested. But that's how I found he was with his ex. When he finally turned his phone off, he denied it until I sent him screenshots of his conversation with his ex. I'm fairly certain that nothing happened between them as I had him text her something when he got home to prove nothing physical happened, but obviously my trust was broken for a while. He agreed to let me see his phone when I wanted to for a while, and shortly after this, I saw a conversation with a girl he fucked before (C) where he was flirting with her and trying to get nudes. He was mainly talking to her about having a threesome with me. This is something we've both wanted to do for a while (although we agreed to put it on hold until we sorted through our trust issues and were in a good place in our relationship), so while I was upset that he did this without telling me, I didn't look at it as a huge deal and more of a misunderstanding about how to go about finding a 3rd and when.  I told him that I didn't feel comfortable with him talking to her or anyone about threesomes without me knowing. He agreed and it hadn't happened since. 

So this brings us to today. I went back to jail over this last summer for a few months. At first it was rocky, he heard some rumors from some people we used to use with about me hanging out with my former friend.  At first he believed that I cheated on him but I was able to come up with enough proof that I didn't even see the former friend. But since then, we've been doing really well, are back to trusting each other and neither of us feel the need to snoop, until the other night. I'll admit I was wrong to snoop. But while he was driving, he handed me his phone to send a fb message to someone, and I saw he had been recently talking to C again. The message that I could see without opening seemed a little flirty, but I didn't bring it up or read the conversation immediately. I wanted to trust him and tried to push it to the back of my mind but couldn't. Early this morning, I decided to open the conversation. I mainly skimmed through, but still found a lot.  They sexted and exchanged nudes pretty much the entire time I was in jail. He also told her that he has a crush on her (which honestly is what broke my heart the most) and implied that we were in an open relationship when she asked- which I respect her a lot for. There was more talk about threesomes with me as well. He also gave her his kik that I didn't know he even had, so there was more that I'll never know about.

This prompted me to see if she was the only one, and i found out she was not. He had texts with a mutual friend of ours who we've both had previous flings with. He had deleted almost all of their texts and fb messages, but in the texts he still had, he was saying very explicit things and said ""if you fuck me on my own I'll let you fuck my fiancée with me when she gets out"".  Most of it was about threesomes as well, but clearly he wanted to fuck her behind my back alone. I don't know if he has met up with her but I don't really think he has as of right now. 

Oh and he mentioned being on tinder to C while I was in jail. 

So that's where we're at. I'm not totally convinced that he full blown cheated on me, but I don't know. I don't know how much right I really have to be mad about this, either, after what I put him through while he was in jail. The entire time he was in, he was convinced that I was cheating on him and I fucked up enough that he had reason to believe that.  While I was in jail, I almost hoped he would if it made him feel better about me hurting him.  It kills me that I put him through what I did, especially because I had believed that he was totally loyal while I was in jail and really tried hard to make my life easier while I was there. But now I don't know what to think. Part of me thinks I deserved it and we're ""even"" so to speak. But at the same time, i think context and intent matters here. I never set out to fuck anyone or had any interest in doing so. Apparently he did. Even if he didn't plan to cheat on me physically, he was still emotionally cheating on me and was seeking out to. 

Please tell me how best to deal with this. I don't want to leave him and don't believe that we need to end things because of this. Couples counseling is definitely needed and we've been talking about it for the last year or so. Things have been going really well, he absolutely is the love of my life and I know he loves me just as much. But as of right now he knows I'm upset and I told him why more or less but didn't go into detail and tell him exactly what I know or how.  Obviously I'm going to tell him I snooped when he gets home but I don't know what to say or how to address this or how upset I can even be. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR-

My now husband had reason to believe I cheated while he was in jail, I made a lot of mistakes and broke his trust although I didn't cheat. We moved on, I went to jail for a few months and only just found out that he was sexting/exchanging nudes with at least 2 other girls while I was in jail and tried to get at least 1 of them to fuck him behind my back. Don't want to leave him, and don't know if I have the right to be that upset after what I put him through before.",relationship_advice
439,e6iv4f,SomeRedLips,1575560407.0,0,Should we break up or keep going? What are steps/improvements we can do to stay together?,"So i’ve been in a relationship with this dude for about 7months now. We met on tinder and started off as fwb but ended up dating and it was a smooth sail before. I had an internship over the summer far away and last semester we were still transition from fwb to bf and gf so we saw each other only a day or two during the week. 

This semester roles by (probs 5months into our relationship) and we’re closer than ever,  we end up hanging out everyday and sleeping at each other’s places. This is when I realized he’s a hardcore pothead and smoked a lot. I’ve smoked before too but was never exposed to this much and never met someone who regularly went to buy from a dealer. Idk why but weed is just a turn off and a deal breaker for me. Nothing against people who smoke, but it’s like some people don’t want to date alcoholics, or short people or brown people, idk it was my thing i didn’t want to deal with in a relationship. The first month or two of the semester i brought up my feelings about weed and him smoking and how he acts when he’s high (not really present, can’t hold an intimate conversation..couldn’t feel like i could really connect with him) but i never spoke up cause i didn’t want to be controlling. Eventually, i thought to myself that i’m dating to eventually get married and i just didn’t want to marry a pothead. So we had this long talk and i brought to him my concerns, i made sure not to be like stop smoking weed, i tried to just say “i don’t see myself dating a pothead or getting married to one”, putting the ball in his court to make a decision. He offered then that he’d try and quit after his last batch was done. Also multiple times during our relationship i’ve emphasized SO many times about trust and honesty (since i had trust issues during my last relationship). He told me a few days later on his own that his batch was done and that he was done and i was so surprised and happy. A few days later, i’m on his laptop and his messages are there so i see that his roommate ended up buying more and he would text him saying things like “hey can u leave the bong in the bathroom” “don’t tell my gf abt the weed” “can i sneak into ur room to get a chop”. I was extremely angry more so about the lying and hiding. I too have this bad habit of threatening relationships as a consequence (ik unhealthy af something i need to work on greatly). He ended up apologizing a lot and we ended up having this huge talk in my room about it and we talked out legitimate steps for him to gain my trust back and quit for real this time. Everyday since our talk, i asked him how he was doing with quitting cause i understand that it must’ve been hard (i’m addicted to nicotine so i get it). I’d ask if he was craving it or how he was doing and if he had smoked. I also mentioned multiple times saying that if he lied to me again about this we will be done, and that if he has a slip up he should tell me because worst i’d get is pissy for 2min but i’d appreciate his honesty and help him through it. 

Well a month of asking him everyday if he’d smoked and him saying no way, i end up reading his text with the same roommate again and find out that 3 days after our first talk after he got caught lying that he smoked. The night i read that i felt so played and immediately came to the conclusion that i had to break up with him. A week before all of this i fucked up at a party and got really drunk and had broken his trust by saying i wouldn’t let anyone write on my chest (it was a costume party and i was paper and had markers for people to write on my shirt) but this girl ended up writing on my chest and even though it was a girl i still broke his trust with that. But at that time we talked through it and i thought i made it up to him because after our talk and time he sensed fine and seemed to have forgiven me. 

Anyways back to current, i went to telling him that i don’t trust him and being mad at him and didn’t know if i wanted to be in the relationship. Then he went on to tell all of his friends about all of my fuck ups and his and apparently they think mine are “10 times worst than his”. Now the situation of the current conflict of him lying to me about the weed again was over shadowed by my past actions that i thought we were past and i feel as if my feelings have been minimized and he wanted to bring it up to make both of us at fault. 

Idk what to do, i love him so much but now it’s like not only is our trust even more weak, we have third party conflicts with his friends cause they all say to just break up with me. Idk how the tables got turned, but it’s so confusing and i feel like yes both of us have made mistakes but in light of the current situation i didn’t do anything and i’m the one apologizing and confused.

Easy thing would be to break up ik, but i’m so attached at this point ....are there any actual steps to recover from this or are we doomed?",relationship_advice

So this year for Christmas I bought my bf a cameo (personalized video message) of one of his all time favourite sports players. Last night we were watching tv in bed and I had my phone charging on his night stand (he only has the one). I got up to go brush my teeth and when I came back, I picked up my phone to see I had gotten an email from the cameo website asking me to rate the video from  the sports player. It said his name right in the subject line and all that info showed on my lock screen. Usually I don’t think this would be a problem for most people, but it’s been an ongoing issue with my bf of him picking up my phone and reading notifications whenever it buzzes. He doesn’t go through my phone, but we could be cuddling in bed, I’ll be half asleep and my phone with buzz with a game notification and he’ll pick it up and check what it’s about. Earlier in the relationship he would stand over me and watch what I was doing on my phone or watch me text other people, and I told him he needs to stop and he has since worked on that. But it’s still an issue. Anyways, I have no doubt that while I was brushing my teeth, my phone buzzed from that email and he would of seen that I bought him a cameo from his favourite player.

441,e6iul7,gg_noob_master,1575560342.0,1,My ex-wife (28) is asking me (31m) to reconsider giving our relationship a chance after she left me last spring. I found someone else (31f) and i’m completely lost.," Making it as short as possible. I was married for more than 9 years to my first love. We had met very young, grew separately and reconnected in my early 20’s. After a very pationate teenager’s love, our mariage was kind of hard. She had to move away from her family, start a new career,…It wasn’t easy for her and really made a toll on our relationship but we made it works until last spring where she left me to go try to live on her own. There were no prior fight or change in our relationship before that. It was very hard for me, and i’m sure for her too. But I survived and finally met someone else. We have been together for almsot 3 months. 

A couple of weeks ago, my ex-wife called me and she wanted to talk. I need to specify that she had no way of knowing I met someone else. She let me know she made a big mistake, she misses me and everything. I told her I met someone and that her coming back was so unexpected that I needed time to process everything. 

Fast forward to today, she shows me she really thought everything out and she really seems to have taken the time to do some introspection. We had quite an unbalanced relation in the past where I would take care of most things and would, in a way, shelter her from hardships the most that I can. That was part of my introspection. Can’t do that anymore. Not good for anybody. So she realised how good we were together, tells me she want to take care and give me back everything i ever given her, …

She was my first love. Even after everything, I still feel like we were meant to be. And we went through almost all our 20’s together. But I met this other girl. She is a fine person, she cares for me and really, has done almost nothing wrong by me. These three months were happy moments for both of us. I feel I am what she wanted to have, and in a way, she is a lot of what I wanted. But she doesn’t really master my family’s langage, she doesn’t work and is very picky about finding something to do, and she has no specific direction to where she is going. She is thinking of going back to school for a couple of years full time and/or applying for a job about 7 hours away in the next couple of months. Meanwhile I have a well established career and I was kind of hoping to enjoy life for the next couple of years before having kids (what were our plans with my ex-wife before she left). Seems like I would be sharing my life with a broke college student again. 

But I came to care alot for her, and I feel like an asshole to let her when she did nothing wrong and she needs support going through all her life change (job,school, …). She is a sweet girl and I think she sees me as important in her future even if we haven’t been together for that long. On the other side, giving my mariage a new chance seems logical. I can’t get my head around chosing someone I know for 3 months for someone I know for more than 10 years. But everytime i think about sitting with her to tell her we should part way I am a mess. Yet I just don’t see a long term bright future for us. Even if I wanted to. I am just looking to pick your thoughts about it.",relationship_advice

How do I explain this to my current date that I need time before we get physical and how do I get over my feelings so I can make this work? I feel like I'm failing to be a good partner.",relationship_advice
446,e6ipb7,ayush13malviya,1575559713.0,1,In a relationship with a married woman.,"Hi
 I am a 30 year old unmarried guy. In October 2018 a beautiful girl commented on one of my social media posts. I write poetry. First I thought that she just might be some poetry fan and would have liked my poem. Then one day she added me on that account. So i politely asked as if she knows me. She replied that she just happened to like my poems a lot. One thing led to another and we got our numbers exchanged and started talking. She looked my age and I was single at that time. Slowly I came to know that she is a married 35 years old woman with two kids from her 14 year marriage. She told me that her husband was an abusive man and that she has endured every abuse in these years. She also told me that there is nearly zero physical relationship between her and her husband.
Needless to say that I visited her city and went to her home. She was alone and although we had developed an intimate bond over the months, all we did was kiss. The next day however we went all the way not only once but many times. Now I visit her city once every two months for a week and we get indulged.
In the beginning I thought that I was just having sex with a dissatisfied woman and that it meant nothing to me. But after a few months I realized that we are actually falling in love with each other. The problem is that she can't leave her husband due to financial and social pressure as well as because she doesn't want to leave the kids. I have a different problem. My parents will be heartbroken and would disown me if I  went ahead and married her. She knows this. Now the problem is that my parents have arranged my marriage to some girl. I am not in a position to say no as it will kill my mother. She is a cardiac patient. Now I am about to get married in 4 months and I have no idea what should I do. The woman I am in relationship with has said to me that she can't live without me and would die if i married someone else. Please help me!",relationship_advice
447,e6in31,conflictedinbigcity,1575559438.0,0,Should I (F38) have a baby with my BF (M40) if I don't love him and don't plan to stay with him LT?,"TL;DR: I don't love my boyfriend and he doesn't make enough money to support the lifestyle I am accustomed to. Being I am 38, should I have a baby with him anyway and find someone who is better for me later? I should note that I froze >30 eggs at 32 so I could have a soccer team given the right daddy and age is not an issue for me as far as chances of conceiving, but of course there's just common sense upper age limit for having babies. 

I am in 2 yr relationship with my BF, we live together. We are both divorced and he has a son, i don't have any kids. I am not in love with him. While there was initial attraction, enough to give it a go, I can definitely say I don't see myself growing old with this person, not after getting to know him for 2 years and living together for a year. He's not sophisticated or interesting enough and he doesn't have or make enough money, and I don't think that's gonna change.  But he's kind, ok-looking, tall, agreeable, treats me well and is good in bed - so clearly not Mr. Right, but Mr. Good Enough for Now. 

The biggest issue for me is that he doesn't make enough money. I am not gonna go into the specifics.. I make 2x of what he makes and we live in one of the top 3 most expensive coastal  cities. On our combined income, and factoring in that 25% of our combined pre-tax money goes to support our dependents (his son and my elderly mother), the numbers just won't work. We live in a 1Br and don't have a car and we barely have any money left. I am able to save of course but he barely stays in the black each month. If we had a baby and needed to get a 2nd bedroom and a nanny, that would set us back an extra 4K a month here and he wouldn't be able to carry his half. We'd have to move 40 minutes away and drastically cut our lifestyle to do that. I just don't see myself doing that, I don't think it's worth it. Forget skiing vacations and summers on the shore, forget nice clothes and going out - welcome to the grind of 1.5 hrs commute on top of 10hr work day and never having energy to play with your child in the first place. All of my girlfriends who are primary breadwinners have this horrible life, they are all miserable and I am not looking to join their ranks. No thank you.

It is occurring to me though that there's another way. I can have a child with him. Sure it won't be my dream scenario where I get to decorate the nursery in between my yoga classes while my husband is slaying dragons at work. But, I will get a baby out of it, I can use this guy to help out for a couple of years (we can stay in a 1br while the baby is small), and then read him his rights and send him on his way. Said baby will come with the constant cash flow stream of child support, which is not a lot but better than nothing - definitely will cover most of the college tuition, and there are PLENTY of men in their 40-ies and 50-ies who are divorced and have their own kids and will date a woman with her own kid (but not looking to have more kids). So I will just find me one of those, someone I can actually connect with and enjoy spending time together. We can combine our families. I can do that at 45 or 50. And, as far as money, realistically given the nature of my up or out career path, I the next 10 years I will either be making 7 figures or be washed up. There's no middle ground scenario for me. So, I will either be able to afford my lifestyle on my own, or would have to move out of this area and live a completely different life anyway. 

As it stands, i feel like I should either have a baby with him, or break up, and do it fast. Like, right now. Because honestly, if I am not getting a baby out of this, I could be out there dating other men and having fun, as opposed to coming home to his boring face and he doesn't have any money to take me out or do anything nice together anyway. So what am I doing here exactly? 

There's a part of me that says ""this plan is crazy, you should find someone you LOVE, and have a family with him, you deserve happiness, yada-yada-yada"". But then there's another, cynical, part of me, which says: ""take what you can get and run. There's no time for you to be looking for Mr. Right anymore. This is better than nothing. Not doing so is crazy""

448,e6imm6,MeTreServr,1575559382.0,2,My [F22] best friend is only 19 and just got a bunch of plastic surgeries. Am I overreacting?,"Backstory, my girlfriend is 19 years old and recently got quite into Korean YouTube bloggers/beauty idols, fashion, and make up. She is a VERY down to earth person so I'm surprised she is the type to get plastic surgery. I knew she was very strict with her skin care regimen and make up but I didn't expect her to get any plastic surgeries. It was already surprising to see her start wearing make up, circle lenses, wigs, and spend a bunch of money on fashion and make up products. 

Now we have a long distance friendship and after a long time I got to meet her again. I don't know what procedures she had done, but her face looks so different. Fuller lips, thinner/smaller nose, and at least a few other things. She basically made herself look like a doll. I asked her directly about it and she told me she had a ""full face done"" for 20k!!!

I am quite shocked that she literally spent all of her savings to get surgeries done. She texted me how her forehead will be numb for a full year (wtf!) And how she has to sleep on an icepack. I am happy for her that she now looks very conventionally pretty, but her old face wasn't that bad and I'm scared she'll get surgery after surgery.

I have no idea of the names of the surgeries but she had different Asian procedures on her lips, not just fillers but a lift, something to make that bow more pronounced and the dimple above it, a nose job, something to make the forehead more rounded. That's crazy, she had like 6-7 procedures at least???

452,e6ijq3,sadcartoonman,1575559025.0,1,I found my (22m) girlfriend's (19f) nu pictures on popular Instagram page,"My gf and I started dating roughly 6 months ago. She's been pretty much perfect in every way, she's very caring, attentive, affectionate, loyal, willing to compromise. However, I know that she's been very different in the past because she had some issues in family with her father. 

When we started dating, she had some nu images of her on her insta page. She had like a thousand of followers iirc, and the pictures weren't too inappropriate (her breasts were always covered by hands, panties always on) but I wasn't comfortable. Partly because I don't want everyone to see something this private, and partly because many dudes were leaving inappropriate comments on her page and it was making me very uncomfortable.

I told her that she could keep the pictures on her insta but she should delete those inappropriate comments because they were making me feel bad. She agreed and even deleted the pictures because, as she said, a girlfriend shouldn't act like that, that was her past and she's changed etc etc.

But recently I stumbled upon a big nu page on insta (of the guy who photographed my gf) and saw that he still had photos of her. The problem is that: 

1) the pictures were much more sexual (her breasts not covered, pictures with other girls, even a picture without panties)

2) the guy has a LOT more followers, so many, many more people had seen my gf naked

3) she never told me about this.

I am very, very disgusted right now... I am very uncomfortable with stuff like this, sometimes irrationally (I have an issue with obsessive thoughts that I work on right now with my psychologist), and she knows how uncomfortable I am with this. I immediately confronted her about this, asked her why she never told me and she said that this wasn't her page so she thought it wouldn't bother me. 

This is an issue with boundaries and she made me very uncomfortable. For six months I didn't know about the fact that thousands of people were looking basically at my GFS nudes at her will. To me this is the same as if she flashed her boobs at 10000 people on street. 

M very sad and uncomfortable about this, it makes me sick. This is something that we discussed and she did this to me. She said she'd ask the guy to delete the pictures but my trust to her is shattered a bit now and I honestly don't want to talk to her. But I still love her. What should I do?

453,e6iiuj,jethrospike,1575558909.0,0,Fiancé (28F) wants a year off birth control,"Hi all.

I have been with my partner ten years and we are getting married next year. Everything is good, we have ups and down like everyone does, but as a man I do find myself sexually unsatisfied quite a lot. I think I would nearly always have this with one partner, so there isn’t much I can do there. We have sex probably once a week or maybe fortnight due to libido timing mismatch, work, tiredness etc. We do other sex acts to fill the time gaps.

Here is the issue - my partner wants to go off birth control as she’s been on it so long. I respect women are taking a hit on this so can’t argue much there either. For me, using condoms is essentially not real sex for men although I recognise the importance in stopping serious disease. Condoms don’t reliably stop herpes, chlam, and others which are more common than HIV etc, so unless you were in a high risk group then for me they haven’t really been part of my life before I ‘settled down’. I am really worried as this takes sexual frustrating to the next level, and will put more pressure on our sex life. We have had sex a couple of times since this change and for me it’s been a non event, I can’t barely feel anything, and the hotness of actual real sex is totally gone for me. Sometimes I can’t even finish with it on!

I (36m) am in a toxic relationship with my SO (41f) and I need to know how to properly break away.,"Ok so forgive me for a long post, I will try and make this as ""to the point"" as possible. Let me first describe what I mean by ""Toxic"" to you, at levels you may have probably never heard of, and preface that by saying I have never cheated or even talked to another women in a flirty way. I have endured the below things for many years now and am holding back tears at work while writing this:

1) She has my location at all times.
2) I am to tell her where I go, even if it is out of my seat at work, or to go to the gas station.
3) I have to message her every 5 minutes to check in.
4) I cannot go to stores alone.
5) I cannot have social media.
6) Alone time with friends or family is taboo.
7) I am constantly reminded she can do better than me, physically and personally.
8) I am to record my way in from work, way out of work, way in to my apartment etc. on my cell phone and report any women I see.
9) I have been hit, punched, smacked, scratched to the point of significant blood, slapped, punched in the balls, pushed. You name it, it has happened.
10) She shames me and has publicly embarrassed me many times.
11) Everything I do is criticized and I catch her on gas lighting me a lot.
12) She belittles me about my weight and my past and reminds me that nobody wanted me back then and nobody will now.

I can go on and on with this list but by now you get the picture. I have never hit her or started any physical altercation, but I have pushed her away, held her away from attacking me, and grabbed her arm/wrist to stop her from hitting me. Which brings me to the reason why I am stuck in this. A few years ago now, during a time where she was hitting me, I grabbed arm wrist to stop her and I guess I grabbed a bit too tight in panic/fight or flight because although I did not break her wrist, I damaged her tendon. As the man, I will be villainized for this and she holds that against me. I wish it never happened. I was defending myself from being struck repeatedly. I offered to pay for it all and I am.

I am desperate and have contemplated suicide many times because I feel stuck here and will face abuse as long as I am here, but if I leave I could be ""found out"" for hurting her in retaliation. I have kept pics of her attacks on me in case I ever need it. I would post it here but it is kinda NSFW. 

TLDR: In a highly toxic relationship and stuck because I blocked her from hitting me and hurt her in the process. I am stuck and need help to get out in a smart way.

I hold nothing against her and understand she was technically single and we discussed we weren't exclusive at the time but it really hurts me to think about, as I feel i wasn't enough to satisfy her or to get her to like me as much as I liked her.

I love her deeply and truly believe she now loves me back, I definitely want a future with her but I can't let this bother me and her forever.

I have a few insecurities as anyone does, and one of them is sex, and I know her situation with him was purely sexual which amplifies this insecurity. I have a much higher sex drive now compared to her and can often feel frustrated which might be why I feel this jealousy.

What do I do?,"**tl:dr I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years and we've talked about marriage but he's dragging his feet on everything in our relationship. Should I give him an ultimatum?**

Long story short - I'm 31 and my boyfriend is 36. We've been together for 3 years and he's moving into my apartment in a couple of weeks.

We're really happy together, so we’ve had various conversations about the future. I've made it clear that I want us to get married at some point soon. I’m 31, and I’d like to be married by 34 at the latest, ideally 33 because I want to enjoy being married for a bit before having to start trying for a baby. I know I’m already cutting it close in terms of my fertility.

He said he wants to get married too. He’s also said that because his parents got divorced, at one point in his life he didn't believe in marriage but he then changed his mind. This really worries me, but he's said repeatedly that he definitely wants marriage and a family with me.

My problem is that he takes forever to do anything - he's an incredibly slow mover when it comes to our relationship. It took him a YEAR to tell me he loved me, and it upset me so much that I considered breaking up with him. It then took him 2.5 years to decide he wanted us to move in together. He firmly asked me to live together back in March, but then put it off actually happening until this December for no real reason. I asked him why so many times, but he just made various excuses that made no sense.

When he talks about the future, he talks about stuff like us buying a home together, or having kids together - not us getting married - even though I've made it abundantly clear that I would NEVER buy property with anybody I wasn't married to, let alone have a kid with them.

I'm now starting to get really upset and worried about how slow he's moving, because I feel like it doesn’t take 3 years to know what you want when you’re in your 30s. We also went to six weddings this past summer and I'm starting to feel really left behind.

My boyfriend has a close friend who dated his partner for TEN YEARS and they only just got married this past summer. My boyfriend didn't even think there was anything wrong with this. I've made it very clear that I won't be a 10 year girlfriend because I won't wait around forever for anyone. I've told him where I want to get my ring from and he's said he'll start saving for it in 2020 but I feel like this is yet another stalling tactic because he'll take forever to save up the money.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. We are incredibly happy together but when I think about how slow he is it really gets me down. I don’t want to be strung along for years and years. Do I give him an ultimatum?",relationship_advice
462,e6ida7,UnanalyzablePeptide,1575558232.0,4,My (24) boyfriend (22) has poor hygiene and gets pissed off when I try to help him make better habits,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years. I love him very much. He is sweet and caring and supportive. However, his personal hygiene is..... not great. He doesn’t consistently brush his teeth, refuses to wash his face even when he showers, and rewears clothes that should definitely be in the laundry. He also doesn’t wash his hands after using the bathroom every time. He DOES shower at least every 2 days. 

When I remind him to do these things, I feel like a nagging mother. He’s been on a new medication that makes his skin SUPER oily, so he has been having issues with acne all over his head. Along his scalp, behind his ears, on his face, etc. I have many different acne medications on hand and offer to let him use them regularly. He just says “they won’t work anyway so what’s the point”. 

Lately, I’ve moved on to just trying to get him to wash his face once a day. Last night I told him that if he didn’t wash his face before bed I’d dump a cup of water on him and do it for him (overkill and unnecessary, but it was REALLY bad). He grumbles and goes into the bathroom, where he wets a piece of toilet paper and starts to wipe his face. I ask, “why aren’t you using soap?” He responds, “it’ll tear up the toilet paper.” I pick up a washcloth and hand it to him. He wets the washcloth and starts to squirt some hand soap into it. I ask what the heck he’s doing, and tell him that hand soap will just make his face worse. He gets more pissed off at me, but uses one of the oil free face wash bottles I leave conveniently on the counter.

He claims that washing his face won’t help, nor the acne medications, but he hasn’t tried either for more than a day at a time. I tell him that in order to see improvement, he has to do it every day. He says he’s too lazy to do that and it won’t work anyway. 

How can I deal with this? I don’t want to nag at him, but I also don’t want to go to bed every night and wake up to pillows covered in oil from his face and scalp.",relationship_advice

464,e6ich3,Ethereal_Umbreon,1575558139.0,2,Is coworker (22F) interested or is she just being friendly?,"Reposted from late last night because I wanted more opinions! 


Let me preface this by saying that I have a terrible anxiety and the prospect of dating, honestly even a girl being possibly interested in me, drives my anxiety through the roof. This causes me to over-analyze everything and worry about it. But at the same time, I’m lonely and want a relationship. Talk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

So anyways, last Friday, a group of coworkers and I were talking about chicken wings and where you can go for specials on them. One of my coworkers (we will call her Alexa), a girl I had a slight thing for, said that she enjoyed going to my favorite wing place and got the same flavors of wings. So I suggested we get wings together and she agreed. 

When I suggested it, I genuinely meant it in a friendly manner. I just really love wings and get them at any opportunity. 

However, later in that same night at work, she suggested to me that we should get drinks afterwards at our job. I said sure and then jokes “Oh you want to make this a whole thing.” She replied with, “Like a date.” Now, I’m going to be completely honest with you, as soon as she said the word date, I kind of blacked out. But I don’t think I responded other than chuckling nervously.

A few days pases and I’m working again with my best (work) friend. I tell her about what happened and she replies that she thinks Alexa has a boyfriend. I’m bummed but I just shrug it off and move on. 

However, then Alexa and I become Facebook friends and it clearly says on her profile that she is single. So I’m like fuck it and message her asking if we are still getting wings. She replies yes, she is down. So I give her a time/day and the day and she replies saying “Yes! My number is (blank)! Text me so I don’t forget.” That was last night. Then I texted her today, we had a quick convo and I let it drop after that. 

What confuses is me is:

1) Her possibly having a boyfriend. 

2) Saying the word “date.” Unless you have a well-established relationship with someone of the opposites sex (or same sex if you’re attracted to them), I think word date is a romantic word. 

3) Her suggesting we get drinks at our job. Because this could mean that she WANTS our coworkers to know we are out or she doesn’t care because it’s just a friendly event. 

I told you. I overthink and over-analyze EVERYTHING. It kind of sucks because I over-analyze because of my anxiety and then that makes my anxiety worse so it just snowballs. 

I know I’m probably dumb. I know this is probably clear to everyone else. But does it seem if she is interested or do you think it’s just friendly?

Side note: She has never been flirty before. Since she began working here a few months ago, we’ve been friendly and chatted a bit but I never had the notion she’d be interested.",relationship_advice

467,e6ibg0,lemonsnlemonade,1575558013.0,1,Parents are involved...,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 5 years. 

We moved from one state to another, and he has found an amazing job in his area, which can be tough to get. My background is a little more niche, and while specifics don't matter, my most recent job was quite high level, but in our new state, I'm unable to get anything beyond entry jobs.

I spent a few weeks at home to try and get my head straight after struggling to find work, lots of fighting, not knowing anyone here, and very little money due to only one income. Rent is high in our area, and we're just getting by.

My issue is this, I was offered a position back in my home state. It is high-level, great pay, and the distance in traveling is cheap and a couple of hours. We could visit each other at weekends etc. He is very unsupportive. 

It has gotten to the point that he has been ringing his parents and doing so privately, while we used to always do these calls together, or I'd at least be in the same room. We are all close, have spent a lot of time together and I have previously stayed with them on my own. Now, he has said that his parents are unsupportive of this, and I feel gross about how much they know about his emotions (and mine) about the situation. I am not close with my family in this way and do not share details of my feelings or our struggles. 

I believe in communication with friends/fam is important to have and helpful to process emotions. But this feels like it's crossing a line for me - and dragging our struggles into a familial discussion it should _never_ have been in. 

Am I being unfair in feeling this is a financially smart decision, as well as professional opportunity for me, and that it should never have been discussed with his fam? He is very upset over the physical separation - but I am feeling like I'm being backed into a corner to make the *right* decision now that his family essentially are involved. 

Yes, I do see the irony of inviting strangers into the convo but I feel like I'm being told I'm in the wrong here for a fairly normal consideration to make ends meet??",relationship_advice

We moved to my home country from hers 3 years ago for her to study at uni. I didn’t want to and always resented it. This past summer she went gone for a month and I stayed here. During that time I found myself on pornographic sites and ended up on sites where you can pay for pictures and videos as well as interact with the people on it. I found myself drifting into it and before long I was spending hundreds of pounds on this site and talking to these people regularly. I never thought I was hurting anyone. At the same time I was also spending money on virtual currency on computer games. A lot. This last week we had been fighting about money and I had been passive aggressive and mean. She discovered an open credit card statement and saw what I had been spending on and discovered what I had been doing. She has been gone for two nights and last night we had a talk about everything and everything came out. I was never intimate with these people but obviously I have betrayed her. I don’t know why I did what I did and before I knew it I was too deep. She has said she doesn’t think she will ever get the image out of her head and the hurt I have caused her. She keeps in communication and says it “isn’t over” but I don’t know. I just feel so bad and I don’t know how I could have done this to her. She has asked for space so we don’t hurt each other anymore. I don’t know what to do.,relationship_advice

We went on a break back in may because i was pushing to talk about having kid (in 10 years) and she didnt want to talk about. She said that i disrespected her boundaries by asking so many times. 
The break lasted 2 months during that time she fuck two female friends. Fucking other people wasnt something we agree on she told me wed get back together and as soon as she fucked other people the break was then a break up. 
It was hard as hell but i started to move on. I started talking to her as if she was a friend. 
She then said that she missed me, she made a mistake, it was a manic episode.       
I took afew week to come around but we got back together. And everything was going great. I felt loved. I felt like i was getting what i give. We talked about kids and came to an agreement that we were both happy for. Things were going amazing, untill 2 days ago.

So after spending the weekend together she brings me back to my house. We watch to new baby yoda episode and she falls asleep on the couch cause we're both alittle under the weather. I lay down beside her and cuddle her and i notice her phone. 
My girlfriend has a rule about me not being on her tech. She doent like it when i use her computer and shes never given me a chance to grab her phone. She always said its because of childhood trama which i believed but curiosity got the best of me.  To my surprise her phone is unlocked and i went to her Fb Messenger.  I saw the name of one of the girls (lets call her Jan) that she had fuck when we were on the break. I clicked on her name. 
I know they were friends and there is friendly flirty going on. Which in my opinion is fine, it's OK to be a little gay with your friend sometimes. But as i was scroolling the friendly flirting turned into my girlfriend telling Jan that she wanted to get naked and smoke with Jan the next time they hung out. My gf told Jan that she had a dream about Jan fucking  her at a concert. Jan said that she wanted to practice being a dom more and my girlfriend said that she could practice on her.  My girlfriend told Jane to pick the music next time they fucked.

I took a few pictures of the messages with my phone because i didn't want my girlfriend to turn around and try to gaslight or get out of it somehow. I didn't even get past October before I started getting so angry that I was just shaking so I went upstairs I called my friend told her about it. My friend told me that I should confront my girlfriends so I did that.
My girlfriend knew she was in the wrong read away she apologized.  
Cut to 2 days later I don't know what to do. 
 I don't know how to make it work anymore 
I want it to work out but I just don't know how she can possibly fix it. I dont know where to start.",relationship_advice
470,e6i8s7,RengS_98,1575557677.0,3,Any advices on long term relationship?,"Sorry for poor formatting. Really new to all this.

I’ve been dating this guy for a while now. He is really nice and he really enjoys talking to me(he says it hemself) and always gets enthusiastic when he sees me. But theres this one small thing that bothers me about him that I know it shouldn’t because it shouldn’t be a big deal, but it really does. That small thing is that he doesn’t respond to my messages half of the time that I text him.

I usually text him right away whenever he sends something because i really wanna spend time with him even if its just over messages. Even now, he woke up and asked me how was i and he still havent replied 5 hours later. He did said he will go for a lesson that lasts 2 hours and maybe for a shopping.I just find it highly difficult to believe that he can't take 20 sec of his life in those 5 hours to check a message and reply atleast anything. I'm waiting eagerly every day for his messages.

I understand that there’s other things he has to deal with or worry about everyday that are more important than having a conversation with me through text, but I just find it weird that this happens so often and he doesn’t simply text a message saying he's busy or something.

Am I overthinking or is this something I should actually do something about? We usually talk 2h a day over a discord or messenger when we play games we both love and everything is okay. We make sure to tell each other how much we love each other every day and i'm really happy that i'm with him but this bugs me so much. Mainly because all i want is to spend my time with him considering we are in long distance relationship so seeing each other in person isnt possible yet.

I told him i care too much and that's simply who i am and i don't think i wanna change that. I want to make sure he knows how much i love and appreciate him but this thing is just killing me.

Is it problem in me? Maybe im too needy? so he doesn't feel comfortable responding? I just can't help it. I can't stress much i love him. I miss him in between those quiet periods, but it feels like that feeling isn’t mutual sadly.",relationship_advice

So we were dating from last 3 yrs & everything was pretty amazing for 2 yrs & than we started fighting a little but used to patch up quickly & maybe we both made a fault there of not solving the issue just fcsd on cmng back.In Nov18 we fought & we broke up Till thn I became comfortable with the rltnshp & thought she will never leave me & stopped putting efforts in small things,stopped appreciating her efforts.After this brkup she told me that there will be no relationship now but we kept talking & kept flirting back & forth & the chats and calls were as usual.She accptd that she is trying to move on but can't & we kept talking like couples for 5 mnths but We never tlkd about rslvng the issue & i didn't put effort bcuz I thought we just fought because there were many issue & there is nothing to be rslvd.Those 4-5 months were weird ,we were not in a relationship but it felt like we are in one atleast to me.Than in June 2019 I shouted on her for something and it hurted her real bad & I instantly knew that i made a mistake, I was ashamed of it and I apologized to her.I thought at that point now it's all over.I initiated the talking again after few days we talked like friends & in the initial time she was stiff in rplyg at the pace but after 2 mnths there was some change & she opened a little bit & started talking on phone & chat more frequently,I made sure I treated her as a nice friend through out this period.In November I apologized again for my mistakes & asked her to come back & she told me that The break-up hpnd 1 yr ago & those 4-5 months I was like that cuz i couldn't control my emotions but now it's too late & I see you just as a friend. It shocked me & I gave it a thought I tried again after few days & it failed again she told me it makes no sense talking about these things. Now I realise my mistake of taking her granted & it's too late and I regret what I did.Will she get her feelings back in future (4-5 months) if I really change myself & than talk. Do girls get re attracted after such thing ? Ps- I can still talk to her when I want we are on talking terms.",relationship_advice

The girl he cheated with was engaged at the time to someone she had been in a relationship with for a large number of years.  Once her fiance found out, they broke up and she got with my best friend.  Her and my best friend have been together for around 3 years now and over time I have learned to forgive what they did and move on to accept their relationship.  My girlfriend, however, absolutely hates my friend's girlfriend and my best friend.  This has led her to telling me that I cannot be friendly to his girlfriend.  Over time, I have not had any reasons to not be friendly to her since I got over the mistake they made three years ago with each other, so I have started being nice to her.  I was afraid that my girlfriend would not understand and tell me that I could not be friends with my friend anymore as she has tried to tell me this in the past, so I hid the fact that I had become friends with his girlfriend.  Keep in mind, there is no romantic affiliation between me and my friend's girlfriend and we do not see each other outside of hanging out in groups or her being at my friend's house while he is there.  Once my girlfriend found out I had hidden this friendship, she threatened to leave me and, after talking a bit, told me that I cannot speak to my friend's girlfriend when I am with my friend and is telling me that I can't see my friend when I travel home for Christmas.  I have no reason to do this other than my girlfriend not liking my friend's girlfriend and it is putting a lot of stress on me because I feel like she is trying to control me.  She also is going to start regularly checking my Facebook account and cell phone texts and says that, if my friend's girlfriend texts me, I am to immediately tell my girlfriend about it and not respond.  I have not dealt with a situation like this before.  I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years, we have an apartment together and I moved to my current city to be with her so the investment I have in this relationship is very high.  I understand that I should not have hidden my friendship with my friend's girlfriend, but I feel like I am being punished for a mistake my friend and his girlfriend made three years ago that had no effect on my relationship at all other than the reaction my girlfriend had when she found out that they had done that.

We started off great, we both found what we were looking for in a partner and couldn’t be happier. Fast forward to now and we fight a few times a month and sometimes they’re so bad that she will packs her bags and threatens to leave me unless I change. She says I have anger issues, and I know I do but I know what I have to do to avoid exploding and saying things I don’t mean. 

For example, we had a fight yesterday because she told me that if my yearly family Christmas get together is on the 28th that she won’t be coming because she will be too hungover, as she is going to a party with friends. It’s usually the only time my entire family gets together for the year and yes it is on the 28th so I expressed how disappointed I was and that it’s so shit that she won’t be coming. She said sorry but didn’t even compromise like say maybe not drink so much and still be able to come, it was just not coming at all. I was annoyed for the rest of the night and gave her the cold shoulder. This is where the fight begins, she tells me to get over it and that I shouldn’t be carrying on about it for this long.  But I wasn’t happy, i was so disappointed! She then tells me that I’m making her feel like shit about it and that I should apologise to her for making her feel like this. The last thing I felt like doing was apologising since she was the one who made me feel like this in the first place.

All I really needed was a few hours to get over it and i wouldn’t be so disappointed but she kept pushing for me to stop acting the way I am. I kept saying to just leave me alone for a while and I’ll be fine, but no she told me I have anger issues and I need to deal with things instead of pushing them away. I wasn’t, I just wanted time!

She then told me I have anger issues and I need to get help, at this point I wanted to blow up because I just really didn’t need to feel attacked. So I grabbed my keys and went for a drive for 20-30 minutes to cool off, I just needed to not have someone in my face telling me how I should feel and for how long. But to her, me driving off for a while is me not dealing with things and just running away, when all I want is some space. I prefer to talk about things and solve the issue once I’m not so disappointed or angry. Is that ok?? Or do I need to talk about it right there and then because she wants to?",relationship_advice

I have trust issues. Plain and simple, but this is going to be my first time really adventuring into them and asking for HELP figuring out if I'm wrong to trust my girlfriend.

I've been cheated on a fair amount, only over the long distance relationships I've tried. I'm a high school junior, and maybe I'm just too young for all this.

So. Here's the story. This is the second time I've dated my current girlfriend, the first time about 2 years ago. Went well for a while, but at some point through the got absolutely hammered drunk- at the age of 14, mind you. I was woken up in the middle of the night to pages upon pages of texts in a drunken haze from her. Towards the end, the last two pages or so, she started to talk about how horny she was and all the things she wanted to do with me, blah blah blah. She then dropped the bomb that she wanted to have ____ lick the whiskey off her pu***. A bit later, I got a haphazard explanation, her stating a few days later when I brought it up that, in fact, it was her COUSIN she was talking about. She also explained that her cousin fooled around with her friend, not my girlfriend. Girlfriend and cousin are female, friend is F-to-M, no surgery or anything.

That was about two years ago. Same people were over last weekend, I guess her only real friends and companionship. That's fine, from various accounts of the other twos relationships I'm okay-ish with them. BUT over Thanksgiving, they were over and of course they smoked and such, because I guess that's what normal 16 year olds do these days.

Well, last night I just found out they all got drunk together. Again. Which would explain the many hours of silence at one point. Next morning, never got an explanation as to what was going on but assumed friends being friends.

Am I wrong to trust her? She knows my 'issues' with her drinking in the past, yet chose to anyways (with the same people).  It's definitely a sore spot for me. Am I too controlling? I understand if this is my fault and if I need to back off.

What do I do next? Is it reasonable for me to worry about solidity, honesty, and the faith of her in the relationship?",relationship_advice

Me [25f] and my ex[29m] were seeing each other for like a year and a half. I loved him so dearly and I truly believe he loved me too. We were semi living together in a house he has just bought and we remodeled, getting a dog together, planning big trips around the world together, babysitting his niece together... and everything in between. 

We had our issues but before a big trip about two months ago I found out that he had been hanging out with a girl behind my back. I was hurt and almost didn’t go but with some convincing and assuring that nothing happened we had an amazing trip. 

Yesterday the side girl explained to me in DMs that her and my ex hooked up before and after a big trip we took together. With proof and she said she only found out about me after they hooked up after the trip. Where she cut off all ties with him.  

With that and him constantly texting his ex girlfriend whenever he got drunk, not prioritizing being an adult (never doing chores) I knew we had to end things.

When I confronted him about it he basically said “I don’t need to tell you anything, I don’t owe you anything”. “Do you need me to help you pack your stuff up”. “Everyone things the world of me, I don’t need you” 

I feel stupid but honestly thought we were going to end up together for the long run and I’m just really hurt. I had always been that girl that never wanted to settle down bc I liked having my options .... and this was the first guy I really loved.

480,e6i2ie,abwtech,1575556847.0,57,Sex life dead at 23: Me (23M) and my girlfriend (22F),"Hey Reddit users, this is my first post ever, so letsagoooo. First some background info. I am a 23 year old male who met my gf, a 22 year old female in our freshmen year of college. We have been dating for 5 years. We didn't have vaginal intercourse until year 3 and were each others first and only partners in terms of vaginal intercourse. I am the only sexual partner she has ever had. She is only interested in receiving penetrative sex, but not oral.

**Main post:** As of August 2019 we have had sex about 8 times, when we used to have sex at least 15-20 times a month. She started working a new job in August and we moved to a new apartment, so I chalked it up to stress and change of environment. October hits, our anniversary comes, she has this look of disinterest on her face when the topic of sex comes up, so I tell her never mind don't worry about it. This past November we had sex twice, and we haven't had sex since, so it's been a full month. We've talked about it multiple times, and she says shes just not interested. Shes told me her vagina burns after sex, so I suggested she go to the gynecologist, but she refuses to go saying that she is fine. She said she rarely orgasms and is now turned off, so I suggest she let me try new things like toys or oral, and she say no or that shes not interested. She says she's still attracted to me, but just isn't in the mood for sex. She doesn't give me BJ's anymore because she said it gives her a stomach ache. She never initiates and when I try I get rejected. I told her I can't keep going on like this, and that I feel like she's not even trying to nurture that part of our relationship. She has told me I can sleep with other women, but not date other women, I have absolutely no interest in that. She is definitely in love with me and I can say with 100% certainty that she's not cheating on me. I don't want to end our relationship over this, but I see no other option.

Any advice on what I should do?

Update: Thank you everybody, your responses were amazing and gave me the kick i needed. Your comments made me realize that i'm willing to do whatever it takes for the relationship and she's not. I asked her if she is willing to go to the doctor or start therapy, and told her that if the doctor doesn't find anything, i'll stay with her and just be happy that she tried as hard as i'm trying, but she said she doesn't want to go, and she does not have a reason for why she doesn't want to, so unfortunately I broke up with her. She's devastated, but I don't understand why when she could've prevented it. I just made sure she was okay, and now i'm just sitting in my car in a dollar tree parking lot. Life goes on.

He eventually asked me out on a date. It went well. And we’ve spent a few nights in at his place. He kisses me hello and goodbye whenever I come over and before I leave. We also text a few times a week. One time he even invited me out to spend the day with just him and his group friends and he introduced me to some of his female friends whom I had never met. We’ve never discussed what we are. At first I thought it had potential to be more than FWB’s but one night when he had a little too much to drink he started saying things like “this is just casual. We’re just FWB, right?” And I said “sure”. However I don’t think he remembers that conversation ever happening. Since then I have given up on it being more than FWB and have been fine with things how they are. However, he just threw me a curve ball by asking me to his works holiday party. Which to me sounds like something you would only invite a serious date to. I know you guys are going to say that I need to have a conversation with him about what we are, but before that happens I’m just curious what your thoughts are? Does he want to stay FWB? Does he want more? Does he even know? Was he just desperate for a date to the work party? Please help.",relationship_advice

she was scrolling through her phone and i saw a few pictures of her in a bra on snapchat, i didnt say anything because i assumed that to be normal. and then a guy texted her on snapchat and she called him bby

i asked her about it she said it's a ""bad habit"" she has, to call her close childhood friends bby. She said she'll stop and apologized. I bought it, kind of because she did that in front of me so no big deal

And then in October, she posted a picture of herself being held by a guy a day before her birthday, it looked way too intimate to me but I didn’t say anything 

i thought it's okay for a girl to have male friends she was just being inconsiderate, and then yesterday i found out that she has a second instagram account that I didn’t know about 

i got a bit angry and asked her about it, at first she treated me like an idiot. What she did was she sent me a meme. “Me when I see you”, I kept on pushing so she finally said it’s just a friend. 
 
That second Instagram account is full of pictures of her and this guy, with intimate pictures and captions like “jerio and I are totally catfishing” And there are also portrait pictures of that guy 

I’m not comfortable with this at all! I guess I’m not that upset about her having a close male friend. it’s because there’s nothing about me on her social media and that in account it looks like  they are the couple. And she hasn’t introduced me to any of her friends yet.

Every time I confront her she says she didn’t tell me because she didn’t bother because there’s nothing to hide. Every time I ask her to introduce me to her friends she changes the topic or comes to visit me from that town she lives in 40 km away.

I don’t know what to do now, I’m thinking about going there by surprise and introduce myself to her friends. But I still want to give her a chance to introduce me to this jerio guy and tell him that she’s dating or he is just a friend.

I wanted to give her space and make her comfortable but I’m in misery so what’s the fucking point.
 Anyway, tell me what do you guys think I should do now, thanks in advance",relationship_advice
483,e6i1gj,tir3dAlways,1575556705.0,1,I think my fiancé hates me.,"So 2 months ago I gave birth to our first child, I invited my mom to be in the room with us when the actual birth took place because my mom and I had gotten really close during my pregnancy (a little context, before I got pregnant our relationship was ok we just weren’t talking very much because a year prior I had been living with her & she was extremely abusive physical & verbally) after we left the hospital my mom was supposed to stay with me for a week to help me cook and clean, really just to help take some stress off of me with the new baby. I was extremely nervous about my mom coming to stay with us though because we lived with my fiancé’s mom helping her pay the bills because she was barely staying afloat prior to us moving in, his mom has bipolar disorder and is known to become violent & is extremely erratic, I witnessed her episodes several times while living there. My mom is also bipolar & very violent and erratic, well the first day of me being back home my mom was in our laundry room doing our babies laundry to help us out & his mom rushes into the laundry room & tried to do the laundry for some irrational fear that my mom was trying to break our laundry machines, his mom tried to pour some strongly scented detergent in & my mom told her she didn’t want to use that because of the baby’s sensitive skin and she proceeded to pick up some free & clear detergent to show my fiancé’s mom & she tried to rip it out of my moms hands out of nowhere but my mom didn’t let go so she just stood there & violently shook it while my mom was holding the bottle & started screaming about how I needed to get my mom the fuck out of the house right now and started screaming at me while I was holding the newborn baby, my mom started flipping out and said we could not live in the house with her with our child because she’s dangerous & demanded we move to Tennessee where she lives, fast forward some, my fiancé & I are staying at his grandpas fixer upper house, it had water and heat and everything else it just wasn’t the nicest looking place because they were working on it, my mom then started saying that we were basically homeless and all kinds of other stuff and started threatening to take our child away, she said either I come up there for as long as it takes my fiancé to find us a place or she’s going to get involved legally, my boyfriend didn’t want me to go but I felt as if my mom was you to rip my child away from me so I went anyway, I was there for about a week & he no longer wants to marry me. He says I kidnapped his baby & that I ruined his bond with the baby, I don’t think he’ll ever forgive me but I only made the decision out of fear & I really regretted it, I apologized profusely but he just doesn’t seem to care. He treats me completely differently now, I’m still in love with him but I think he despises me now. He’s 21 m I’m 21 f by the way. I just want some opinions on the situation I guess. He feels like I’m trying to get custody of the baby & leave him & that I’m cheating on him or something now when I’m not.",relationship_advice

486,e6i0cx,Throwawayfellaman,1575556564.0,1,I (19M) keep obsessing over girls who give me the slightest bit of attention. How can I stop feeling?,"Hi all.

Recently I have found myself thinking a lot about a girl who started at my work. She's really nice to me and bothers to make conversation with me, which is something I don't really have with girls.

Every time this happens I think about the person a lot and then eventually get burned. They'll have a boyfriend or are interested in someone else etc. Every time I think it'll be different it just ends the same.

I'm really tired of getting burned so I want to stop feeling things for people. I'd rather not feel any emotions for people than go through my life being disappointed over and over.

Any advice on how to do that?",relationship_advice
487,e6i0bf,nosesinroses,1575556558.0,0,"My boyfriend (27M) took up what was once my favourite sport, but I’m not unable to participate in fully due to physical injury. Not sure how to feel?","I am 25F for the record. We have been together for nearly a decade.

When we first got together, I had a traumatic lower back injury. I had to go in for surgery and I am still affected to this day. Before that, I used to be in track and field and loved to run. I am still able to run luckily, but of course running is one of those sports that’s horrible for your lower back, so I am not able to push myself very far. I still love the sport, but it hurts me, and I don’t want to re-injure myself.

Last year, my work signed us up for a 10km run and we could invite our SOs. My boyfriend got hooked after that (he hated running before).

Since then, he hasn’t stopped talking about running. It’s literally persistent, every day. He has spent money we don’t have on running gear and keeps asking me to spend hundreds on races. He goes for runs nearly every day, and recently completed a half marathon. His goal is to run a full marathon.

Our weekends always used to be spent together hiking.  He knows I need these hikes to keep my back in shape and my mental health well. He has met another girl who he now plans to go running with on weekends, instead of hiking with me. I have no other means to go on these hikes. The plan is he will drop me off to do them by myself from now on...

I have been honest with him about my feelings - I am obviously envious and this just makes me feel like a pile of shit. It constantly reminds me of my injury and limitations that I have worked so hard to overcome. I also told him that I don’t want to prevent him from doing what makes him happy.

I am just worried that I am not strong enough to handle this constant reminder of what I once loved being taken away from me.

We have tried to go on runs together, but he complains my pace is too slow. It broke my heart when I saw he was posting our runs to his Strava and calling me slow. I also currently can’t run the long distances he wants to run all of the time (over 10km). So he has just been doing his own thing.

I don’t really know what to do besides just accept it, but I worry it will break me. It seems so wrong to ask him to stop - I did suggest perhaps slowing down or at least rubbing it in my face a lot less. I also asked if perhaps there is another sport he would find a similar joy in that we could participate in together, or that would at least not make me feel like a useless piece of garbage.

I don’t know. I know it’s wrong of me to want him to stop, I don’t really want him to - I want there to be a solution that makes us both happy. I think a lot of what bothers me about this is a complete lack of sympathy on his end. He just doesn’t seem to care that this hurts me so much.

TL:DR; Boyfriend got obsessed with running. I used to love it, but can’t physically do it anymore. I want to support him but the envy is so strong, and I feel a lack of sympathy/empathy from him which makes it worse.",relationship_advice

We dated once before and things didn’t work out but this time around things seem to be going really well. Last night me and her were texting and she gave me the heads up she was going to send me something sexual over Snapchat. Prior to me receiving it and opening it I did check her snap score on Snapchat, I know I shouldn’t do this because it’s creepy and stalker ish but I have trust issues and I just couldn’t resist the urge. So after she had sent it and I opened it I noticed that her snap score had gone up way more than it should of and it looks like based off the numbers she sent it to two other people. I’m not really sure how to handle this because I feel embarrassed and weird if I say I stalked her snap score and I also don’t know 100% if that is accurate as sometimes snap scores are slow to update.

We have been together for 10 months and are both in college. She’s had a really rough semester and has said to me a few times that she feels bad whenever she’s on campus (she goes home about every other weekend). When we talked about this a month ago I asked if I had to do with why she felt so bad, but she told me that I was really the only thing that made her happy here. Then about 2 weeks ago we had a serious talk about how we were feeling, again she said that she really cares about me and doesn’t want to lose me, and that it was just school that was making her feel bad. We decided to try a few things to help with that (like communicating more and talking about positive stuff) but since then we haven’t really done that.   Regardless of not really trying that, I thought the last two weeks were really good. We seemed to be getting along super well and I was really happy with her. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we’re both under a lot of stress with finals and are working on a lot of projects. We both had a really rough day and were feeling terrible. We start arguing and she starts bringing up all these things I had no idea about that bothered her. She says that we don’t have the same interests and it feels like we don’t fit well. She also says that we’re both unhappy (with all the stress and anxiety) and that she has been feeling really bad all semester. I’m a little shocked because I knew she felt bad but she always told me that I made her feel better. I said that it’s just a stressful time and once we get through it things will be better. She then says that we need a break and heavily implied that it would lead to a complete break up. 

Last night I got basically no sleep and felt sick to my stomach. I’ve been constantly thinking of ways to figure this out and hopefully fix things with her before I lose her for good (if I haven’t already). I would really appreciate any advice for what I could possibly say or do. 

Currently, I’m planning on maybe buying her some flowers and cookies or chocolates. And going over to her apartment tonight after class and making a big romantic gesture to show her how much I care. At the same time though I don’t want to smother her, she didn’t specifically say she needed space but I mean a break is pretty clear she doesn’t want to see me...I don’t want her to think of me as some clingy guy who won’t give her any breathing room, but I also don’t want to just sit here and do nothing. I guess my other options are to just try to call or text her and talk it out, or just give her space and hope she misses me and eventually ends our break. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post but I could really use any advice you might have. I’m a complete mess right now and I’m trying to study for finals at the same time, I just can’t concentrate on studying when I’m constantly thinking of how to deal with this.
Thank you for your help.",relationship_advice
491,e6hvoc,Injani,1575555931.0,0,I [23f] insulted my boyfriend's [24m] weight and now I think he might have an eating disorder?,"My boyfriend gained a lot of weight the second year we dated. I think he got depressed, he ate badly and drank quite a lot. He was never morbidly obese or anything but he gained enough weight to the point where I lost attraction. He was happier when he was slimmer, I wanted him to get back to how he used to be for his own health and confidence, but there wasn't anything I could do since encouraging him nicely didn't work.

I became resentful and took it out on him in a way that was mean and out of character, I started making comments on his weight and joking about it. There was one time I was frustrated with him because he always complained about his weight and didn't do anything, so when we arguing I called him fat and disgusting and said I could do so much better than him. It went both ways though, he called me a bitch. I apologised for the comment but I think it hurt his feelings a lot.

I would also get annoyed with him if he ate something bad and I would try and control what he ate. I never had sex with him because I had lost attraction. I still cared about him a lot though.This is going to sound horrible to say but I also resented the fact that I was slim and took care of myself while he was overweight, so I tried to avoid being seen with him in public, especially in front of my image conscious friends. I never posted pictures of him on my Instagram like I did before he gained weight. 

Eventually he started dieting and losing weight and I was really happy for him and encouraged him. He started exercising and going to the gym like he used to. 
I noticed that his diet started becoming more restrictive but I encouraged him to push himself harder and exercise more.

It got to the point where he was only eating a couple hundred calories a day and I encouraged him because I didn't see how it was bad, he told me that low calorie diets are good for you and I never questioned him. I was really happy for him for taking it seriously. 

He is now skinny again and I am attracted to him again but he no longer wants to have sex, he doesn't want to do anything. He has no energy at all.  He still seems to want me to encourage him to lose more weight? He will point out stomach fat and say he needs to lose ten more pounds, then ask if I agree. Before I would agree with him but now I don't think he should lose any more weight, he is maybe too thin now. 

He says he wants to be fit and healthy not skinny but I don't think he realises what he actually looks like. He still sees himself as fat. I am not sure of his current weight but I think he may be underweight bmi.  He still looks good but I am beginning to worry he has taken it too far and I might be partly to blame for it. I am glad he lost weight but he still seems unhappy. He has completely stopped eating in front of me so I have no idea what his diet is like. 

I don't know why he's doing this. Could it be an eating disorder? I obviously I want to help him if I can but I don't know how to undo the damage that I might have caused to his self esteem? He says that I was ""right"" to comment on his weight so it's not like he's mad at me though.


Is it my fault?? How can I help him??

He’s still a puppy and strong and big as heck, chewing up everything, getting on the bed, I’m sick right now and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s because of the sh*t particles on my bed. We’ve only had him 5 days and I still don’t want him. Since my boyfriend works and I don’t, I’m supposed to be taking him out during the day and dealing with him in our room. He can’t go all over the house for a few obvious reasons, including having a cat and bird in the house and the cat has been hiding since the first day he got here. My boyfriend says he would choose me over the dog but as many times as i say i’m unhappy he gets defensive and says i’ll get over it and give it time. I don’t want to give it time.

But she has an ex that continues to stalk her and causes her a Lot of anxiety and an unnecessary extra stress to our relationship.,"So, to sum it up as best I can, I’ve been seeing this girl for a bit, it’s going great, but she is very hesitant to do a lot of public activities due to the fact that her ex stalks her. She is genuinely afraid of him not in a violent sense, I don’t believe, but more of just discomfort. Whenever she leaves practice twice a week he is always parked in the distance and is waiting for her to leave. He contacts her friends intermittently to ‘check in’ on her since she blocked him from everything. She even decided to drop one of her minors just so she could graduate this summer to get away from this guy. They dated for a significant amount of time but broke up at the beginning of the summer. She doesn’t go out much anymore and feels safest at home, which is understandable. I’m not sure if it is a situation that merits going to the cops for a restraining order since I don’t know how much good that would actually do or if it can be resolved simply by a blunt but respectful confrontation with him or just ignoring it. Anyway, the crux of all this is that I feel as though it puts a strain between us that I want to resolve in any way I can but also want to be respectful of her past and let her deal with it how she sees fit.

494,e6hut0,cxcxcc9,1575555817.0,1,i (20F) don’t think my girlfriend (19F) loves me anymore,"So I’ve been with my girlfriend for one year, we live together. The beginning of our relationship was great, but i truly feel it spiraling down hill and it’s out of my control.

The past two weeks or a little longer I have just been feeling so unloved by her, as if i’m just existing and she doesn’t care if i’m around or not? I’ve been asking her to just show me love and be nice to me, but she says she is being nice and showing love, however she is not in the slightest bit. She has been sort of hostile towards me i guess you could say. I feel like whatever i say, or do, she has a comment on, and it’s not usually a nice one. If i say something, she’s quick to correct me (even if that’s not what i was talking about?). 

If I try to talk to her, about how her actions or words effect me, she doesn’t want to hear it, or simply just doesn’t see an issue in her actions. She never just kisses or hugs me, I have to ask for it. I just want to be kissed or hugged or told I’m loved? That’s all I really need. When I’m touching, or loving on her, she also doesn’t seem to want it that much. If i’m kissing her face or hugging her, her expression is just blank, I get nothing. 

Yesterday, she picked me up from therapy, and the music was on in the car. I got excited to talk to her and tell her something, so I turned it down a little and she got angry. She said “didn’t you just talk for an hour, what do you have to say?” and that made me feel like absolute shit? Just because I talked to my therapist for an hour, means I can’t talk to my girlfriend? I just kept saying never mind and forget about it, because after that, I really didn’t even want to tell her what I had to say, it became unimportant in my mind. Then, we drove to the mall and as we were walking in the mall, I saw the tag hanging out of her pants, so I tried tucking it in? She got all angry and was like “what are you doing” i said “fixing your tag?” and she said “I don’t care if my tag is hanging out, leave me alone.” I was like leave you alone? I’m sorry I didn’t want you walking around with that hanging out, just like i’d tell you if there was something in your teeth? I said “fine whatever i’ll just leave you alone then?” and she got all angry being like “yeah then i’ll never kiss or hug or touch you ever again”? I was really at the point just like what the fuck is your issue and what did i do for you to be this angry towards me. When we got back in the car I was obviously upset because I didn’t know why she was acting like that? and she was like “would you stop?” i was like “no you upset me can you just apologize and understand how that upset me?” and she got all angry AGAIN and started yelling, saying she was being sweet and didn’t understand why I was upset for. I just pretended everything was fine because she doesn’t see how she upsets me anyways. The night went like usual and we just went home, had dinner and went to bed. 

So this morning, as I was leaving for work I went to kiss her goodbye. She seemed kind of annoyed with me again or pissed off. I kissed her, but she didn’t seem to want to kiss me back that much? I said “I love you” and she said “love you” in a faint whisper. I said “promise?” and she said “promise”. I kissed her a few more times, but just felt like I was kissing her, and she wasn’t kissing me back. Obviously I started to cry as I was walking out the door, and cried on my way to work because I really just want her to show me love, that’s all i want. I want to know that i’m loved, I want reassurance. Every time I bring this up and say I don’t feel loved, she doesn’t see how she isn’t showing love, but when I tell you she doesn’t, I promise she doesn’t. She barely ever says I love you, never ever touches me unless she’s just laying on me and i’m cuddling her. She seems to not want to be around me because when I’m around her, her focus is just on her phone or other things. All we do is argue lately, nothing has been good, i haven’t felt good and i haven’t felt the love from her. 

I feel like she is just mentally checked out of this relationship and no matter what I do, I can’t fix it. I’m so deeply in love with her, but she has truly just changed as a person. She doesn’t make me feel loved, and I live with her, so I just feel like i’m floating around for nothing. If she could just open her eyes, listen to what upsets me, understands and comprehends the situation, or even acts like she loves me everything would be fine. I feel like I’m begging for someone’s love, and she loves me, but I don’t feel like she does. All I do is sit and cry and cry over it because I don’t think she’ll love me the way that I love her. I hate arguing, I always try to fix it right away, but she doesn’t. I don’t think she wants “us” as much as I do, and i’m destroyed by it. I feel like I’m so far away from her, yet she’s right there. I don’t know what to do but i’m so upset over this, and I don’t think talking to her would help because she never cares to listen and have a calm response, but I also don’t want to lose her.

It was going pretty well, things all moved kinda fast, but we kept open and honest communication that made it easy. We did a lot of drugs together, and one night he was really fucked up on xanax and wouldn’t stop talking about how if things didnt get better in a few months he was going to take his own life. I asked him if he had a plan, and he said yes. I asked him what was holding him back and he said that it was just me. I freaked the fuck out, honestly, bc im not exactly a stable person myself and was scared that slipping up, falling out of love, or meeting someone knew would mean that i killed a kid. So after the drugs had worn off, a couple days later, I started talking to him about us both needing a little space. About how we needed to be two healthy people in a relationship, not a mess of codependency. He was okay at first, just a little confused and questioning. But then it turned into guilt tripping, and then into begging, and then he tried to kill himself by taking 42 xanax and drinking a shit ton a couple nights later. He is in the hospital now on a 96 hour hold. He doesn’t remember anything that he said while he was fucked up, which isnt surprising, and feels like a total asshole for “over reacting and hurting so many people.” he said that he feels terrible for making me feel responsible for his actions and he is just generally more positive about life and his future.

Of course I was immediately hurt/angry/confused, but wanted to try to be rational just in case this for some reason was an old picture. I clicked on the “Date Taken” and the date clearly showed that we were over 7 months into our relationship.

I did more digging and found a slew of nude photos of other girls on Omegle and Skype, and all of the dates show that he was in a relationship with his ex of 5 years when they were taken. I confronted him about other nudes I found (also his best friend’s girlfriend and his ex of 5 years that has “dates taken” listed as when we have been dating). He swears the “dates taken” are just from computer updates and he hasn’t cheated on my over the course of our relationship...but some of the PG pictures didn’t have “updated dates” like he claimed they would. 

I’m extremely hurt, this is a man my whole family and friends love, someone I’ve been excited to start a future with, and who’s family I also consider my own. I feel like everything I thought I knew about him has been a lie. I’m considering ending the relationship, but want to come here to get final confirmation that “date taken” cannot be updated when the computer restarts/updates? I’m feeling so lost and alone.

498,e6hqce,Yourdailysatan,1575555250.0,1,I[19F] cant help but feel sad about my bf's[20M] sexual history.,"The title is pretty self explanatory. I cant help but feel like just another girl. He tells me I'm not and I believe him. He's the kindest, most caring guy and would never enter a relationship without being sure that that was what he wanted. 

Idk why I can't stop thinking about all the girls he's been with and how I was almost just another girl. I can't stop thinking about how he's found pleasure with other girls and made love to them the same way. He's asked to have a threesome and I said I wasnt comfortable and he hasnt brought it up again. And that's something that's just added to the feeling.  

He's such a great guy and I want to get over this. I just need some advice how to. He had noted that I feel distant and I dont mean to be. Nothing seems to get my mind off of it. I do feel insecure about myself (and I never really have before! That's what's also making me so frustrated bc I've always been very comfortable in my own skin). I do feel sad that he wanted another girl in our sex life. I just feel like I'm another girl, a number. He is my 2nd partner, and I'm his 15th. I cant stop thinking about other girls touching him.

I just need a reality check, and some advice.",relationship_advice

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a while now and since the beginning I told her I wanted a serious relationship.

After she secures the job, we will be making plans to get married and move in together.

So essentially she has already said yes to getting married through our conversations. Should I still buy an engagement ring and do the whole “will you marry me” thing? If not, any meaningful alternatives?",relationship_advice

So some back up story

My  parents divorced when i was 5. I was never really close to my dad he  didn't show much interest in being a father. I was always really  stressed when i was going at his home it never felt like home.

But i was thinking well he is my dad I need to make effort so I kept going until this year.

He  earn a confortable wage ( 1000€ more than my mom) and does a lot of  trip with his girlfriend like in Brazil, in the West Indies... While my  mom always had to be careful with every expenses.

I  started my studies in an other city, so I needed to rent a studio. I  don't know if there is something equivalent in the US but i have 9+  hours of class everyday and i need to study at least 1 or 2 hours  everyday after so I can't have a job. In my country my  studies are free so I just asked him to pay half my rent (so  240€/month). And he just refused. While my mom is very supportive of me  and is very proud since I've always been a good student. She is trying  her best to help me have to best condition to succeed.

I  also learned that the bank account he made with all the money that i received at christmas from my grandmother since i've been a child, is  completely empty.

My sister heard  about that so she went to talk to him about this and he kept making up excuses and telling her that I was manipulating her and that I was jealous because they still talk and not me and my dad even though i didn't  tell her anything.

And now his brother (so my uncle) is pressuring me into talking to him.

I would like to know your opinion on this.",relationship_advice

503,e6hnqh,krombopulos_miguel,1575554901.0,1,How long should I wait after meeting a girl to text her?,"So I went out with a buddy to College Night at a local bar last night (we both grew up in the area and currently go to the local University). I ended up running into a gorgeous girl I was on the rowing team with in highschool, who I was never really close friends with and I haven't seen in probably 6 or 7 years. Turns out she goes to the same University. I noticed her first as she was walking by and did the whole ""hey, remember me from high school?"" thing. Surprisingly, her face lit up immediately, she gave me a huge hug and said I looked great and proceeded to talk my ear off for 5 or 10 minutes before having to head back to her friends. As we were saying goodbye she said ""hey if you need anything, feel free to hmu"".

Is it likely that that last phrase was intended literally like a utility thing? Like did she literally mean ""if I needed something""?

To me, the last phrase combined with her enthusiasm made me think she was maybe hinting that I should ask her out. We're still connected on on Facebook and Instagram from HS, and her Facebook page is fairly active and it says on her profile that she's single.

I was thinking a would wait till around lunchtime, we ran into each other around 1 AM last night, and just shoot her a DM saying ""hey name, it was great running into last night. LMK if you wanna grab a coffee at school or over break to catch up.""

504,e6hnpc,throwitawayyyyyy8,1575554898.0,0,I (28F) think my husband (39M) is turning into a selfish jerk,"I've been married for 3 years (together 5) and am starting to realize that my husband really isn't that nice to me.

Here are two examples from the past week, but I find these little situations happening often enough to have me doubting things all together.

Scenario 1 - my husband goes grocery shopping once per week. It's his contribution in part of our arranged chores. I typically make a list of food we need/dinner ideas etc. Often times my husband will also pick up some treats (chocolate bars, pastries) as a nice gesture. Well, this past time he decided to buy himself 2 chocolate bars and nothing for me. I saw he was hiding the chocolate in our office. I asked if he got anything for me and he said ""well I saw you had one left from the other day"" - knowing that it would be an entire week before any grocery trip he just didn't bother to get me even one. I thought this was incredibly rude and inconsiderate. 

On the flip side, when I am out doing errands and I am at a store I know has his favourite ice cream etc. I will always pick up the treats or at least call him to see if he wants anything and he is always so happy I have done that. I don't get why he doesn't do it in return...

Scenario 2 - I had to get my passport renewed and didn't have much time to get everything done before starting a new job. I went out to get the photo taken after a long day and my hair was in a messy bun. Passport photos aren't a beauty contest and I didn't really care about looking like a super model. Anyway, when my passport finally came in I showed it to him and was surprised because the picture looked low quality and kind of dark - I also joked about how I looked like I had a pineapple on top of my head. He said ""I hate to tell you baby, but it looks like you came out of a trailer park"" - ummm ouch... like what the actual F! I'm sorry but a loving husband would not say something like that and I am crying again just typing this crap out.. 

&#x200B;

I am absolutely dreading the holidays and honestly don't even want to be around him anymore. I don't understand where this treatment is coming from or maybe I am just realizing it more lately. This does not paint a very pretty picture. Any words of encouragement or advice would be much appreciated.

It just worries me that I may not ever get to talk to him about important things. He hardly expresses anything to me either. He waited over a week to ask for some space to spend time with friends because he didn't want upset me. The fact he waited to tell me is the only thing that upsets me.

My ex literally waited over 2 weeks to tell me that he didn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore and ended up telling me on my birthday because I expressed to him that he seemed distant. I really don't want to go through that again and so I always tell my current boyfriend to be honest with me if he's upset or has something important to say to me. It doesn't really seem to stick though because I always need to ask if he's upset before he mentions it.

So my boyfriend and I have been together 3 years. Within the first few months, I knew something was different about the relationship than my previous ones because I never felt like I could truly, open up, let loose, be 100% myself with him. I stayed because I thought for sure this would pass.

The entire time we have been together I have always felt like we had this sort of glass wall between us. We did not mentally connect right. I never knew what he was talking about or how to reply to him.

With all that being said, he IS a good guy, caring, would do anything in the world  for me. Which is why I’m struggling. 

I feel like throughout our relationship I grew codependent and I’ve recently grew out of that and see all the issues, and what is not happening in the relationship that makes it unable to work for me.

I’m afraid I’m overthinking and just pushing away a good guy, but at the same time, I feel so lonely in this relationship.

507,e6hn0h,brownieek,1575554809.0,21,(Serious) I just found out my boyfriend (22) cheated on me (19) and I don't know what to think and do. (sorry it's so long),"I just found out my boyfriend (22) cheated on me (19). So on thanksgiving day we got into a huge argument and I was extremely hurt and upset. It was sort of both our fault, and a lot of the reason was due to miscommunication. We made up, but later the next day, I snooped on his phone because he's always so secretive about it. We've been dating for 9 months and he's never even let me use his phone for even for  miscellaneous stuff. Whenever I even turn it on to look at the time, he immediately grabs it away from me. I'm a trusting person and I understand and can respect if he wants privacy. He talked about his ex before and how she wanted all his passwords, phone access, and he wasn't even allowed to talk to anyone (even in class) or leave his own house without her permission. 
However, it was still suspicious so I guessed his password while he was sleeping and looked through his photos. I found nudes of his best female friend and his ex. I woke him up immediately and asked about them.  He told me on thanksgiving he got drunk and went into her phone and sent them to himself. And he used the nudes of his ex to jack off whenever we got into a disagreement and couldn't picture me (he doesn't look at porn). 
I felt extremely shocked. I asked why he did it but he couldn't come up with a reason. He said he wasn't thinking when he took the pictures of his female friend. 
I asked if he ever cheated on and he flat out denied it. Said he would never do that to me. I asked if there is anything else I should know and he told me that sometimes he used tinder just to swipe to pass the time in work. 

We talk for a long time and the next following days. I logged onto his instagram account and snooped around. I saw a muted account, which stood out to me so I read the messages and found out he cheated on me in the summer. We were in different states for 3 months and he cheated on me with other girl. They went out, started drinking and they started making out and had sex on his bed.  Went I read that, I straight up had a panic attack. I never felt so betrayed before in my life. I loved him and I never thought he would do that to me (the girl had no idea he had a gf). I asked why he didn't tell me earlier and he said he completely forgot about this. I don't know if hes lying or not, but I don't feel like he is. He's a lot of things but not really a liar. He's omitted the truth and told half truths, but I don't believe he would straight up lied to my face. Especially on something this big. But at the same time, how can you ""just forgot the time you cheated."" They cheated around 5 months ago but they texted a month ago around the time he left for 3 weeks to go home. 

At the time he cheated, our relationship was going through a rough time. Our conversations were pretty dry and he told me he didn't even feel like he was in a relationship... 

I don't know what to think right now. I feel genuine remorse from him and I do believe he loves me. I told him that if we want to try to work it out, then we have to make some serious changes. He would have to cut out his best friend (the girl who he has nudes on his phone) and never speak to the girl he cheated with. I want us to share our location and let me be able to see his phone at any given time. I'm also leaving for a month to go back home soon and I want access to his social media during that time. I want it to be crystal clear he has a girlfriend in his social media. I want us to be able to communicate better and for him to be able to tell me the complete truth. 

I am foolish for thinking about giving him another chance? I really do love him, but I did get extremely hurt about everything. I believe that if both of us really love each other and tries, we can work out the relationship and be stronger. I don't think it'll be easy and it'll be very challenging at times. 

If I do give him another chance, any advice to help make it work? Are my demands too much or not enough? Is there anything else?",relationship_advice

They plan on having a girly night out on Saturday and then her friend is staying over. When I asked about the sleeping arrangements, my gf said her friend would be sharing her bed. I felt a bit uncomfortable, and asked why.

My gf became weirded out and said that she and her friend have always shared the same bed when staying over at each other's houses. The only exception was when her friend was with her long term ex and my gf used to stop in the spare room.

Whilst I do trust my gf, I just find it weird that her and her friend must share the same bed - we are almost 30 and sharing beds with friends seems like something you do when you're younger. I know my gf is close with her live in landlady and there is a spare room available.  I'm sure her landlady can give this room up for a night if my gf asks her.

Am I being unreasonable here? My gf is really annoyed at me.

She told me to tell her when it's too much...but made sure to call me moody and laugh about it.

She went to smoke weed one night with some friends. Before she left, she said ""20 minutes tops."" 3 hours later she comes back. I wake up and I asked her where she was and why she couldn't let know what was up. She said plans changed and if I was so worried about her then I should've called or texted. She said she felt like she was being interrogated and I was overreacting.

I told her she doesn't have to talk down to me or use inflammatory language when giving me criticism or bringing up issues. She said I was too sensitive and she should be able to say whatever she wants however she wants.

She and some friends are having a bit of a falling out. Because I'm not shitting on them too then apparently I'm taking their side.

She and her best friend/ex (22M) exchanged nudes. She confided in him about the lack of fulfilling sex life (things have gotten way better). He still had feelings for her and was trying everything in his power to get her to brake up with me and/or meet up so they could fuck. After I found out, we had a pretty long fucking talk, she apologized, but she said everyone was at fault. Including me. I asked why and she said because I wasn't fulfilling my sexual duties.

I made it clear I wasn't cool with them still being so close. She said I should move on because they had forgiven each other (what the fuck does that even mean?) and I should forgive him too.

She wants me and him to reconcile. When I asked wtf I did to him, she said it's because I talk so much shit. She says I should stop playing the victim and be the bigger man by reaching out to him to squash things.

When she was going to meet up with a group of friends of which he was apart of, I told her I wasn't cool with him being there. She took that as I didn't want her to hang out with friends period. To her credit, we eventually talked for a while and that ended with her putting some distance between them, but she admitted that shes only doing it so I pretty much shut up. Not because she feels like their relationship is kinda inappropriate after what happened.

I'm kinda just defeated when it comes to bringing up issues. Everything is always my fault somehow and I would rather just bottle it up than having to walk on eggshells or come out of every talk looking like the bad guy. How do I talk to her about this? Is it even possible? Should we seek couples therapy? I'm lost at this point.",relationship_advice

I am 21, and have had two boyfriends in the past. However, I currently commute to college and have found it hard to meet people.


I decided to download Bumble kind of on a whim, I'm not a huge fan of social media. I've had it for about three days now, and have gotten a decent amount of matches, talked to a few different guys, and two of them have shown interest in going out with me.


One in particular is 28, and I am 21. I would consider myself mature for my age, but I am a bit apprehensive about his motives for being interested in me.


We are both in college, I'm undergrad and he is in grad school. We exchanged phone numbers, and I also friended him on FB.


We have already discussed age gaps in relationships and he said he doesn't have a problem with it, and it's more about maturity than anything else. He said he's not interested in hookups either.


I just don't really know what to do or think. Obviously anyone can say their intentions are xyz while lying through their teeth. It's not that I get a disingenuous vibe from him or anything, I'm just wondering if I should run the other way or what your guys' experiences have been if you've encountered a similar situation?

Freelancing, multiple employers through the years. I write articles for a living.

Working online however has made me severely depressed. I've had an on-off depression cycle for the past few years. It makes me sleep 12 hours a day at times, and it can be as long as a year until I get out of a particular 'cycle'. I feel like I've wasted my 20s doing this, but I can't stop. Financials aside, I am also an extreme introvert, and this job 'fed' my loner mentality. I haven't socialized in literal years - unless you count small talks to vendors, cashiers, etc. 'socializing'. I have zero friends - real life or online - and I just play games on my PC all day. It's a loser of a life. I'm a fucking loser with a dead end.

Honestly, it feels more like I'm just running out the clock. The job keeps a roof over my head, and I guess I'll just die of a heart attack or something in a few years/decades without leaving this one-room apartment of mine.

Where do I start? I really want to be with someone. I'm tired of wasting away my life playing video games. It's pathetic, I know, but creating this thread is all I can do since I feel like I'm trapped. At a dead end.

513,e6hjse,throwaway061626,1575554402.0,4,How do I (M25) convince my wife (F25) to go to therapy?,"My wife and I had a baby 5 months ago. Long story short it was a very rough pregnancy and post pregnancy. She had an emergency appendectomy while she was three months pregnant, had a miscarriage scare which we found out later was internal bleeding from the appendectomy. Due to all of that she was put on bed rest several months before our daughter was born so that took a tole on us financially, which we're still dealing with today. When our daughter was born there was some complications and my wife had to have emergency surgery to fix the damage done. She had lost so much blood that she ended up having two separate blood transfusions because her body wasn't reproducing the blood fast enough. There was still a lot of bleeding weeks later so she went to her gynecologist and she recommended another surgery to remove scar tissue and redo some stitches. That was about a month and a half ago and during her follow up she was told she might need another surgery. She's had almost non stop bleeding since our daughter was born.

All of this has taken a huge tole on my wife's mental and emotional health. My mom has depression so I have a good idea what it looks like and I see that in my wife. She has days where all she wants to do is lay in bed and cry. Then she could go a week with no obvious problems. I think she needs to see somebody who's a professional in things like this but I can't convince her to do it. She says that therapists are for people who can't handle their problems; which is total BS obviously. I've explained to her that I used to see a therapist and it helped me a lot. She says she doesn't want to just get drugged up and sent home, which I have also explained is not what therapists do but she doesn't want to hear it.

I can't force her to go to therapy. How do I convince her to go? If she continues to refuse, how do I support her through this? What can I say/do to make her feel better? I just want my wife to be happy. I hate seeing her lay in bed and cry because I don't know what to do.",relationship_advice

Basically we’ve been best friends for nearly two years now and live together on campus. 
She’s been with her bf for over a year and a half. We got along to begin with and he made her happy so I left them to it. 

Turns out he’s a complete and utter disgrace of a human being. He would get drunk and get girls numbers, lie about where he was and who he was with, he’d stop her from hanging out with guy friends that he didn’t like, he’d accuse her of cheating and flirting with other dudes and even downloaded dating apps to see if he could “get female attention” He blames all of this on his insecurities as she’s his first gf and first sexual experience. 
They argue all the time and I’m always there to comfort her. 

It got really bad over the summer and eventually I jsut snapped and told her to break up with him. She told him and then he started to hate me. He’d find any excuse to make me out to be a horrible person. I tell my best friend everything but she tells him so whenever I do something he doesn’t agree with he says I’m a liar and a hypocrite behind my back. 

Anyways flash forward to October and I go out drinking with my course mate (who happens to be one of her bfs friends) We get drunk and he lets slip that there’s a rumour going around that I cheated on my bf with a dude I kissed in a club. 
I told my best friend about it the next day and she said it was her bf that told people (I kissed the guy a week before dating my bf so I could understand why he got confused) 
I told him I don’t blame him for misremembering but that he should clear my name. He said he felt bad and didn’t mean it
We left it at that. 

Then last night happened. 

We went to a Christmas party with the uni and I ended up speaking to his friend whilst the couple were talking. We made polite convo, he asked if I had a bf etc. He was interested in our friend who was with us so I teased about that. I then flicked my hair because it was in my face... BIG MISTAKE

My best friends bf was watching us the whole time and told her that I was flirting with his friend because I flicked my hair and that he was going to tell my bf about it. I was crying and so upset. I had to yet again call my bf and explain that he was accusing me of cheating for the second time. Thankfully he said he doesn’t trust a word he says and agrees that he’s awful too. 

I spoke to my best friend and other friend who was with us. I asked if I was overreacting or ruining the night but they both said he was completely out of order and crossing the line. We ended up getting an Uber back with a bunch of other friends (including the bf) He went back to his flat and me and my best friend went back together. 

She said she was going to talk to him the next morning and sort things out when he’s sober. 
It’s nearly 2pm and I haven’t heard anything from her. Im worried that she has sorted things out with him and is ignoring me as she doesn’t like conflict. I’m more sad than angry. 

I feel like I can’t go out when he’s there as he’ll keep saying I’m cheating on my bf. I can’t talk to my best friend anymore because she tells him everything and it gets thrown back into my face. 

I don’t know what to do anymore?

I love my boyfriend he’s genuinely the most amazing person I’ve met and I care for him a lot. But I’m attracted to older men a lot. Over the years we discussed an open relationship but then we’d never go through with it. The past few months I told him when I see a hot guys my mind goes crazy and I just have this urge to do things with them he told me he feels bad that he’s basically taking my experiences from me and not getting to enjoy what I want. He’s also into young twinks and wants to enjoy some also, after a long talk we agreed we can try an open relationship. So we both set up Grindr accounts I got talking to this one guy (44M) I found really attractive we had a lot of flirty and kinky talking that got me turned on a lot. He could host but never had the time and when he did I was working. So one day after weeks of texting he says he’s so horny he wants my ass and what not, I’m with my boyfriend but he tells me it’s okay if I want to go and meet him. Basically I get there and I’m in my element we’re doing everything and it’s the hottest experience I’ve had. A few days after that night I text him asking him did I please him and would he be up for it again. I didn’t get a straight answer. I’ve texted him a lot and i can’t get him out of my mind he eventually replied and said he’s been super busy that he’ll get back to me in a few weeks. I really can’t stop thinking about him I have anxiety all day and I feel like crying, have I caught feelings for this man? I barely know him yet I really just want to spend time
with him and please him. I’m moving away to Toronto for two years with my boyfriend in January. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to meet with him again but if he texts me and asks I don’t feel like I can refuse. He also lives around the corner from where I work which definitely doesn’t help.

518,e6hfp2,ThrowRAQyoung,1575553832.0,1,"My(28M) mother(52F) is a racist, and it's ruining my relationship with my girlfriend(34F) of 8months.","Big wall of text ahead. Tldr bottom.

Me and my mum have a tenuous relationship. We hardly talk, but it's typically about money. I bought her a house(it's still under my name) and a car that's financed for another two years(again technically mine). We've had issues before about her making racist comments before, but she was my mother. I spoke up the first few times, and because I dislike conflict greatly I just stopped. She wasn't going to change.


It's been 7 days since I told my mother that I wanted her to meet my girlfriend. Things started off Ok enough with the normal questions of like: ""Who is she?"",""What does she do?""


When I answered her, the hate I received was the worst thing I've heard in my life. My girlfriend who was sat next to me at the time, kept asking what she was saying. I translated everything, because it was vile and I didn't know how to hide that from my expression. Over the next several hours she sent me hundreds of texts going on about how I'm making a mistake. Those people have cold hearts. She's using you. She's seducing you. I hate those people. I hate this country. You're driving me to suicide if you do this. Etc. Vile. Evil. 


I hate conflict. I don't know what to do in them. I hardly ever get angry, and I just refuse to live like that. Typically when people are upset and yelling, I tend to just leave. Just remove myself from the situation. Obviously my girlfriend is upset. Then as the days got on, she was more upset with me. How could I let this happen? How could I fund this sort of behaviour? Why don't you do anything about this?! I've told her that while she is racist, she's still my mother.


It's been several days now, I've not spoken to my mother at all, because I just don't want to associate with that kind of hatred. Still, my girlfriend is now putting me to an ultimatum. Either I throw my mother out of my house and take back my car, or we can't be together anymore. She wants me to cut my mother out of my life entirely, or stick up for our relationship by confronting her. 


I've since ignored all of my mothers' texts and calls because it's just not right. It's more of the same racist controlling manipulative behaviour over and over. I hate conflict. I've removed myself from her, and it's not enough for my girlfriend. I'm still funding her behaviour by paying for her car, paying the bills of the house. To her, that's not ok.


What's the next step? Do I throw out my mother and brother? He's not done anything wrong. Do I split up with my girlfriend, who I love to my core and seem to be hurting everyday? 


TL,DR: My mother who lives in the house that I provided her with my brother(13M), and is actively trying to split up my relationship by making racist comments and badgering me. Girlfriend is now taking a hardline against the behaviour, to the point that she won't be with me unless I throw her out.",relationship_advice
519,e6hffl,FlowFreal,1575553797.0,2,How to get over money spent on recently cheating ex girlfriend?,"Recently I took my (24) ex-girlfriend (22) out to a $100 dinner and afterwards bought some stuff for us for $40 that she kept.

I’m an idiot and ignored red flags. We had a big fight, didn’t talk for a couple days, we made up and i took her out.

Found out she cheated, went no contact with her two days ago. Honestly the part that hurts the most is her saying she was going to pay back half for dinner and she definitely won’t now. The “stuff” i bought for us was condoms and some stupid sex toy that is now at her house. 

It just hurts thinking that I paid for shit that some other guy will probably use on her. It’s fucked, i got played.

Should I just take this as a loss? 

Here’s where it hurts too: i bought her nice gifts and a really expensive dinner (total $250) for her bday a couple of months ago, my bday was yesterday. She definitely won’t get me something.. i just feel so stupid spending money on a cheater. 

Is this normal in relationships to feel bad about money spent on an ex?

Edit: we did have sex after dinner. Everything was looking good/normal again. I bought the condoms because we planned a night-in at her place later during the week. Then i found out she cheated.",relationship_advice

I tried to bring it up to him but he insisted that he acts like that ""with everyone"", gets annoyed, calls me crazy, and says he doesn't want to talk about it.

We were really close for the first 2 years and generally hung around as a trio with another girl called Sally (one of my closest friends).

In 2nd year of medical school, Sally and Bella had several arguments and they haven’t been close for two years. Bella is close to Gary, Archie and me. In 3rd year, she stopped speaking to Archie (who she thought sided with Sally) and argued with both Gary and me. 

Last year, I really realised how selfish Bella is e.g.

•	We never go and do activities that I want to do. e.g. I have a love of salsa dancing which I picked up in Cuba – we haven’t been once in 4 years despite repeated invitations. I either go alone or find someone else. The one time she came to a clubbing event I really wanted her to come to, she sat on the side of the club complaining about wearing heels – which I had told her not to wear, leaving me by myself the whole night until I finally caved and we went home.

•	I invited her to my house twice, she'd say yes, change her mind the morning of morning of (after I'd prepared tons of food as well as by my mum, to meet her very specific dietary requirements - e.g. she's vegetarian but will only eat 3 particular vegetables). 

•	She cancels all the time: even when I've inconvenienced myself to work, she chooses to schedule things at the same time as the time we've decided to do something.

•	We were part of a big group chat; she uses my account to send angry messages to people who upset her (without permission) and then go and make up with them in person, never revealing that it was her who was angry. She said the reason she did this is because she hated how I didn't stand up for her - I thought the argument and her messages were childish but apologised for not standing up for her and made an effort to do so.

•	I invited her and another male friend to dinner whilst we were at the station, they both got on the train to go home and then just changed destination to go to the restaurant I suggested. I feel like she purposefully stops me making friends with new people. That guy wasn't my close friend and it wasn't his responsibility to include me; she even said this guy tried to persuade her to just go home and she was the one who insisted. She didn't realise it would upset me, she says.

A couple of months ago, things came to an head. I've always been okay with her having friends that I don't share with her (e.g. people I do not know or barely know). But she started inviting casual acquaintances – people I do know and would like to be friends to events - e.g. 'let's go for ice-cream'. Guys she invites out are not romantically into her and she doesn't frame it as a date, so she goes by herself and he'll come with a bunch of his friends. She doesn't invite me because she doesn't want to invite anyone to come herself, in anticipation he might not bring friends. She becomes friends with all his friends whilst any event I organise or any friends I make have to be her friends too. This just makes me feel lonely because all my friends are hers and there are times where she will go and have an event without inviting me.

I am not allowed to go and do things alone with new guys because she is emotionally invested in almost every guy I know. This means that I am not to spend time without her present there because she likes them. I have turned down invitations from potential friends because she hasn’t got invited too (and would get really upset and mad at me about it).

Just to clarify, I'm not romantically into any of these people. I have a long term BF who isn't from our university. My BF says he doesn’t like how she treats me but also reminds me she is really caring and does think about me at other points.

I don't know what to do. I tried to tell her how I felt 2 months ago, she said she didn't tell me to invite her to events I organised or include her and that was my choice. She then got angry at me for spending time alone with Archie (one of her ex-friends who she hasn't spoken to in a year). I didn't speak to her after that.

She finally messaged today, because I invited all our friends to my house on Saturday for a dinner party. She wants to make up before this party. I don't think I'm ready. I didn't even want to invite her to this party but we haven't told anyone we've argued and it would be rude not to invite her.

TLDR: I feel like my friend is excluding me, and I feel lonely and annoyed. I tried to express my feelings and we argued. I don't want to make up with her.",relationship_advice

I’m looking for some advice I’m in a realy dark place 
I have been with my partner since March this year and we’re seeing each other but not living together.
In September we moved in together she spent all her savings taking me to Dubai for my birthday and the relationship was great.
Since we moved in after the first months something started to change she has a new manger and have change locations to live together this is also the first time she has ever moved out on bin in a proper relationship.
We started to argue and I became very worried as her behaviour started to change she was very protective of her phone and doing lots of extra hours at including popping in on her day off.
I would out on her birthday she had deleted all her WhatsApp messages.
I became increasingly worried and started checking when she was online and her boss and there were bouncing on and off we had lots of fights and I asked her about it directly I also asked to look at her phone and she refused point plank on principle.
We went away and I also noticed the whole time every time I left the same activity and challenged her again and she just said your paranoid and don’t trust me.
She claimed she never messaged him and have never betrayed me.
More recently this all carried on and she claimed it was about work however this was on his personal phone which she wasn’t aware I know.
She consistently goes back home and disappears 
I have suspected she has slept with him one nice she worked late an was reachable and when she got in her phone was on flight mode and she was very reluctant and hesitant having sex and I think there was something in her underwear and felt it 
When she came back cleaning up she had a red face and looked embarrassed 
The next day I get a ring from her boss in my head to smooth over as we work in the same business even thou his contact with me which used to be daily calls ceased when things started to get worse with us.
She also does the shifts and for this month they all match up days off etc for them both
I have tried to speak to her multiple times and she has avoided it every time she has told me I need help have depression and paranoia which I have truly started to believe and started to break my own mind.
Then a week ago my old boss called me and told me she had meet up with an old ex since we have been together for dinner late at night and never mentioned or spoke of being in a relationship with me.
I confronted her about every he boss and the ex 
She denies everything point blank without explanation I asked to see her phone to back up what she was saying and prove it she said no on principle even if we broke up.
She left and said we need space and only admitting the meal with her ex but saying it was just innocent everything.
She told her family but only about the meal none of the rest of what we have spoken around 
She then went out that night and a party he was at and again I saw the same ping pong activity on her phone.
I met her two days later and said one last time to tell me the truth to save us and she just kept denying it and saying it’s all in my head I need help. She’s messaged me the last two days begging me back and she wants to be with me even if I’m insane I realy don’t know what to do.
She was always so protective of her phone taking it to the bathroom in pocket at all times. 
She’s still telling me I have mental issues and I don’t know if I do 

I’m realy starting to lose myself thinking this is all in my head 

I realy need help to find out if this is my head?
And what do I do?
I work with them as well so will be humiliated if I have to go back to work knowing this?",relationship_advice

I had to tell him very shortly that my ex didn’t accept a no when it comes to sex and I therefore have a really hard time saying no now. I literally can’t form the words. He was very understanding about it and yesterday I wasn’t really in the mood at all and he picked up on it without me having to say anything. I tried to say something but I couldn’t get myself to it. Working on it though. 

Now I feel super bad that we just kissed and cuddled. My ex was manipulative and always started pouting or ignoring me. Sometimes he would question if I really loved him. He acted like a spoiled brat. I didn’t tell new guy this part. I’m scared of scaring away new guy by not putting out and he’s scared of scaring me away by being too much. 

New guy asked if I wanted to talk about it and I kind hesitantly said I didn’t wanna talk about my ex with him BUT- and then just clarified that if I do certain things it’s a certain no. This would be like putting my clothes back on after he tried to remove them etc. 

Should I tell the new guy about how bad I feel? I feel like it may help me if he reassures me, but I don’t want to freak him out. But I’m constantly worrying about it too. Should I just try to convince myself instead? That’s it’s fine? I’m having a hard time figuring out how this seems from his perspective and what he would think if I told him how bad I feel.

525,e6h9fm,mossorbet,1575552939.0,1,I want to visit my boyfriend but I can't tell my controlling parents! (F20) (M48),"
My boyfriend and I met online and we live in different countries (a 2 hour plane ride away) So far he's been the one visiting me, but I'd love to visit him (it'd make more sense financially for me to visit him, because I could stay at his place). I'm not planning on telling my parents about my boyfriend anytime soon. Relationships are a taboo topic, and seeing as I'm 20 and he's 48, there's a big risk they would completely flip out. 

I'm 20 and studying at university but live at home with my parents and younger sister. My dad is pretty controlling and paranoid, this summer he wouldn't even let me go to the local park because he was adamant I'd get kidnapped or murdered. He's very scared of the world, to the point that it's incredibly irrational. My mom has become like this too, although she's less aggressive about it.

I've never traveled alone before. I really want to visit my boyfriend this summer but I sadly have to lie to my parents. Do you guys have any ideas?

I have an online friend in the country my boyfriend lives in, she's a girl. Maybe I could say I'm visiting her (which I would do as well) and give them her address? They'd still find it really suspicious because the word ""online friend"" will make them FREAK OUT.

 Whenever I go somewhere they demand to know who I'm with, their phone number and the address of where I am. I've thought of just telling them I'm traveling alone and that I want to discover myself. But the country my boyfriend lives in isn't exactly one that's super typical for students to visit, so that'd make them suspicious. Plus what do I do if they forbid me from traveling alone? Do I just go anyways? It feels so cruel to them because even though they are irrationally controlling, they do care about me. The only other plans I have is just actually going on a trip around some cities in Europe that have lots of art and convincing my boyfriend that that's fun (seeing as it's connected to my education, maybe my parents would be more ok with it...)",relationship_advice

We're long distance until I move to him next year. So far we hadn't argued ever until yesterday. And I feel like shit for it. Long story short, on the 29th he told me he'd be visiting Prague for a few days with a friend last minute because the person who was supposed to go had an emergency and so he was a second option, he's Swedish, travelling in the EU isn't a big deal. I was a bit sad because I knew he wouldn't have time for me while he's out sight seeing but was overall glad he's be out and take pictures for me and what not. Of course while he was in Prague we didn't talk much. I was also very busy with work so I didn't bother him except the occasional ""send me pictures"" in the evenings. He got back yesterday and the friend he was with in Prague uploaded a collage of their adventures together. She's a girl. Pictures of them at dinner that looked like dinner dates tbh. Them in the airbnbs. Walking through the streets at night. Having drinks at a bar. I trust him a lot I like to think he wouldn't do anything but i keep thinking about them travelling together and having a good time while I'm out here. What do they talk about. Does he hug her.

We talked for a while and then after a bit I asked her to be my girlfriend. However, over the 2 months we have been together I have noticed many things about her that I just do not like, mainly the fact that she is very childlike and does not act like an 18 y/o a lot of the times. Very sensitive and seems to always be upset about something, even the absolute tiniest thing. I truly think I rushed into this because it was something new away from home and as an 18 y/o college kid, consistent sex is nice. 
I do feel like I have lost feelings and kind of go through the motions with her at this point, but I really, really want to keep her as a close friend because she is a good person to talk to. How could I tell her I lost feelings in such a way that she would be comfortable staying friends?

I woke up around 9 am. He made an effort to wake up around that time too. He usually doesn't wake up before 1 pm unless he has work, so I normally walk the dog alone. We walked the dog.
On the walk, I mentioned we could go shopping for gloves because I dont have any and my hands have been suffering on the long walks with the dog. To that, he answered : "" Babe... I wanted to get you gloves for your birthday. I dont know if you noticed but I borrowed 20 euros from you so I could. When I got to the shop I liked another pair better but they were more expensive than i thought so I couldn't."" I think I answered "" oh no i didnt notice. Its okay anyway I would like mittens more than gloves to keep my fingers warm "".

 I answered honestly but I could not help but feel sad. I kept wanting to ask him if that meant he had no gift for me. I didnt. I said its okay. We didnt talk more off it. I think he was uncomfortable and felt bad. I felt upset but didnt want to hurt him. The finances have been strained and I have been mostly supporting us. He found a job recently and he is working hard. I dont mind him borrowing because I see a future for us and we agreed we would share our money. What upset me is that it seemed that he did not get me anything. Not a card, not something small. 

We went shopping. I got myself mittens and a woolen hat to go with it. I gifted myself jeans and a top aswell. We had fun shopping we were both in a happy mood. As i tried on jeans, I kept thinking how ive been wanting to buy him a pair of jeans because he doesnt have any good ones. Theyre all very washed out, some are from his teens. So i pushed him to try on jeans and we found a fitting pair. Its not easy so find him jeans that fit because his calves are big and usually dont fit. Anyway I got him the jeans and it made us both happy.

We then went to a burger place and had a nice lunch. We chatted and were both in a good mood. 

Around 5 pm he had planned for us to go to the spa where he works as he is a massage therapist. I secretely hoped for a massage from him. But the rooms were all booked. We enjoyed the warm pool and the lounging area.

Then, we went to a creperie where I had booked us a table because ive been looking forward to it so much. The dinner was lovely and again we got along so well. We wore our new clothes, it felt nice to feel pretty and nicely dressed. Ive been home a lot lately and have been feeling like a mess.

After dinner he suggested we go by the store and buy me a small birthday cake. So we did! He sang for me I blew out a candle and wished for us to get engaged.

Before going to bed he gave me a full body massage.


So the day was wonderful we had some quality time like ive been longing for!! I have been depressed and felt lonely lately because i dont see him much.
I felt so much love for him on that day and I know he wanted me to feel loved and I did.

However, I cant shake the feeling that spending a day together and going shopping for clothes is a nice weekend activity. Spending time together and enjoying that time, is what i want for us on normal off days. Somehow, it feels like he is gifting me his time on my birthday as something special. 
The spa is where he works but I admit its romantic.
 I had to suggest shopping, book the dinner and pay for everything.

What makes it worse is that we had read post about a similar situation on reddit and agreed that a gift was the least a partner should do. We also agreed that my dad and brother are not thoughtful because they never get my mum anything on her birthday eventhough she does everything for them. Just like I do for him.
Also, he knows I was verh upset when my first boyfriend didnt get me anything on my birthday because of finances. Not even a card or chocolates. He agreed it sucked. 


So am I being unreasonable and materialistic to focus on the no gift prepared detail instead of the overall lovely day?? Should I bring it up? Should I  be more appreciative of how he tried with his behavior and attitude to make me happy on my actual birthday?
Im worried he will get hurt and think of me as angry oe negative if i bring it up.",relationship_advice

531,e6h2nz,m00gl3l0v3,1575551952.0,1,I (27/F) found out my husband (30/M) asks his old female friend(s) out when he goes back to his old town. Is this normal?,"Some background: My husband (30/m) is Hong Kong, I (27/f) am Western. He has worked as a hairdresser for years now and worked for about 3 years in Australia. He has a lot of friends there and currently sees an orthodontist there about every 3 months.  We have been together a year, and he has taken 2 trips back to see about his braces.

So to the point: I posted a pic of us on Facebook and tagged him in it. It starts getting a lot of likes, particularly from all the female friends he has gotten over the years from doing hair. I occasionally will check them out. 

I saw this one girl who happens to be Western also liked our photo. Out of curiosity, I went to her page to look at her pictures. All of her recent profile photos had been liked by him, which set me off a little bit because I thought that was a little strange and a lot of liking to be doing on 1 girl's posts. I asked him about it when he got home and he said she was a customer of his from his time in AUS and she became his friend. 

This is one of my big fears with his job of being a hairdresser. I know I am a little insecure anyway, but he's meeting and talking (he runs his business from instagram) to girls all the time, making them pretty, etc. It definitely bothers me, I'm not gonna lie.

He allowed me to look at his messages, and that's when I saw that he told her the past 2 times he went back to AUS when he was going and asked her where she was. They also sent occasional messages back and forth, she sent a pic of herself with 'new hair' and he heart-eyed it. I asked him why he needed to this? We were dating at that time. He said they were just friends and he likes to meet up/have dinner with them when he's there. 
He thought he would make me feel better by telling me that it's not the only girl he asks to meet up while there. He also showed me another girl he asked. Needless to say, it did not make me feel better.

I asked why he didn't just make a group message, explained that it was super shady, but he doesn't seem to get it. I think it may be a culture thing too, and I'm really trying to tell myself he didn't mean anything by it.

Also, almost all of his messages are in Chinese, so I can't read them anyway...

Do you think there is more to this, or am I just being paranoid??

Last night while I was over at her house she told me that her doctors think the cancer has returned. It kind of freaked me out and I think she could tell. We aren’t exclusive and I don’t know what I should do. Is it a jerk move to bail now that she’s told me? I really don’t know. I have a 5 year old daughter and as much as I hate to say it, if I stay with this girl, do I want to expose my daughter to this? Maybe I’m just a jerk.

He shows up to my house and talks to my family when I’m not there. Now his most recent threat is to go to HR.

535,e6gxiy,fuckmylife112,1575551196.0,17,I (17f) feel like I’m being groomed by my cousins boyfriend (32m?),"My cousin and I are super close, more like a mom to me and she’s been dating this guy for a really long time, maybe since I was 10. I never realized it then but he was very touchy with me, like stroking my neck, had me sit on his lap, like caressing my face, etc. I was a kid though and I was a really affectionate kid according to all my relatives. 

Over the years he would continue to do this, the past three years or so I moved and didn’t see my cousin as much but she recently moved to the same city my mom and I are in and her boyfriend is supposedly being really creepy but I can’t tell if I would be overreacting or not. I do want to make a point that I don’t know how “older” guys act, I never really had my dad in my life and I guess the closest male figures in my life are like my guy friends and best friends dads and stuff so I’m not really sure. 

Anyways he’ll kind of do the same stuff, like stroke my arm, literally pet me like a dog or something. My three friends were at my house the other day getting ready to go out and one of them said that what he was doing was fucking weird and after the party we went to his house and he brought it up to his mom and we were talking about it (she’s a child psychologist) and she told me this is very concerning behavior and wanted to tell my mom. 

He’s never sexually abused me, I’m not even sure what “grooming a child” actually means, just that my friends mom told me it seemed like he was doing that to me and that children that have been groomed can grow up to be victims of rape and/or very sexually provocative. I don’t really feel uncomfortable around him or anything and I always felt really close to him.

I last saw her back in April, so it had been a while.    
Now the issue is, I'm not sure how to proceed. It was super fun chilling with her post production over the weekend, I hung out with her both nights, the second ending with us staying up until 05:30.. Some fooling around happened, the first night it was just giving each other massages basically, but we're pretty physical with each other. She just is as a person as well I should mention. The second night though we ended up making out a couple of times, and some more ""foreplay"" (I don't know how else to phrase it without it being blatant af).But I never ended up spending the night or anything, she was pretty adamant about me going back to my own room eventually when we were both really tired. The subject of us came up sometimes but she seemed hesitant, like there was something holding her back. We live a couple of hours away from each other which definitely makes things a bit more difficult as well when looking at the practical side of a possible relationship.    
Right now the thing that's driven me to make this post is that I haven't really heard from her anymore since Tuesday, she's left me on read and I noticed how it drove me up the wall, getting me to worry and shit, which kinda made me realise how I really do have a thing for her that I'm having a hard time dealing with. Part of me wants to just temper my expectations massively and tell myself to ""calm the fuck down"" and not get my hopes up, but another really wants to go for it.What I'm planning on doing is just sending her a message or something later today asking her if she'd like to call and then just be honest, that I really enjoyed spending time with her over the weekend, I love chatting with her, and I would want to try dating.

Do you guys think that's a good idea or should I just let her be for a while longer, and see if she messages me on her own behalf?

Anyway there have been at least 4 or 5 instances within this 2 week period that have made me feel strange. I thought maybe I was trippin’ though. 
It starts out with meeting her, this is only our 2nd time hanging out alone and she bursts into his room without knocking. She speaks only to him pretty much.. but after she leaves I go, “she seems cool!” and he said, “yeah she’s so cute.” And in my head I remember being like.. I didn’t say cute.. 

We were going bowling that night and when she came home he completely changed plans. We waited an hour for her to get ready and the whole time I was hinting that I was sorta anxious and bored. We were sitting on the couch and when she finally came down the stairs, he had a full blown physical reaction. I’d never seen him like this, his leg was going crazy and he was gripping my thigh and stroking his beard. She had on this tight v neck crop top with no bra, and I thought that was wild considering I don’t dress like that around my sis or mom or anything. 

That night wasn’t great and I felt pretty ignored and out of place. At one point she was physically hanging off his shoulder saying, “I have five brothers but we’re the closest in age so we’re super tight, we’re reaallyy close.” And I figured huh my family isn’t so naturally touchy I guess. 

Skip forward to when we’ve hooked up a week after, we’re trying to sneaky because his sister and her husband (yeah she’s married) are doing things in the kitchen next to his room.. it’s dark and he’s going pretty slow and I’m being quiet. Then as soon as he hears his sister voice talking to her husband it’s like he’s triggered and turned on and started going a lot faster. It was so weird for me because it seemed blatant.

My relationship with Maria has thus far been entirely professional.
Monday through Friday, she shows up at 6:30am and I greet her at the door, make her breakfast and chat before I head off to work (at 6:45am). She then basically has been taking care of everything in the home while I am at work or the gym. When I get home at 5PM, I make dinner for everyone and catch-up on anything I need to know. Pay her for her time ($18/hr +overtime on Fridays).

Then I usually do the dishes and am the sole person taking care of our son until tomorrow morning. My wife spending every minute of it buried in her phone and not a second of real relationship time.

Honestly, we have not had sex or any real intimacy since our son was conceived. And I feel a growing dislike for my wife and a strange attraction for Maria. Whom I always find playing with our son every time I come through the door.

I am a pharmacy student about to graduate next year and most everyone I know is in a serious relationship or married. Lots of them are even younger than me. I’m 28. 

My history;

14 years old, I dated a 15 year old for a week. Shortly after that week her dad died and she needed space so  we broke up.

16 years old I asked different girl out and lost my shit when I got rejected and fell into a depression. I had a huge crush on her and asked her to marry me 10 years later in a desperate attempt to get her to come back from Japan or at least talk to me. Not my proudest moment, but it’s an honest one. She never responded / read it and just blocked me. Shortly after she got married. 

18 years old, I revisited girl one to find that she had been a series of bad relationships and hung around her for nearly 4 years. She was dating other guys. She kissed me once but it’s not going anywhere and I don’t want it to anymore.

24 years old I had a one night stand with a beautiful woman that never contacted me back. I felt really guilty.

26 years old I attempted a long term relationship with a woman from overseas. She was the nicest woman I had met but school and me and her didn’t work out. She didn’t feel loved because I always needed to study. It was just too much for both of us. We were together for almost a year.

26-28 I got hung up on this one woman at my school and asked her out a few times. I felt led on but she ended up having a boyfriend who she’ll probably go marry. This one was a heartbreaker.

28 years old, I just met a super cool optometry student and in person! I asked her to go on a date sometime soon and she told me she didn't date that it usually takes about 6 months to decide for her. She's Korean, IDK if that matters. Anyway, we got drunk and cuddled one night and it was very romantic and now I can't get her off my mind. Lately she has become cold and distant. Today I am planning on just inviting her really quick to my room then telling her that I want to be with her and maybe ask to kiss her.  Advice?

543,e6gs9k,autisticfarmgirl,1575550422.0,1,How do I tell my in-laws that we won’t spend Christmas with them for 2 years?,"This is a bit complicated so bear with me (there’s a tl:dr at the end).

I (29F) live in the U.K. with my boyfriend (25M), I have lived here for nearly 10 years and do not intend on moving away. My parents live in Europe, but not in the same country. So mum lives in country 1 (where I grew up) and dad lives in country 2 (where I went every holiday to be with him).

Since I have been with my boyfriend we rotate where we spend Christmas and new year, on a 3 years basis. So last year we did Christmas in the U.K. then new year with dad in country 2, this year we are doing Christmas in country 2 and then new year with mum in country 1, next year it’ll be Christmas in country 1 and new year in the U.K. We feel that it’s the only way to split ourselves fairly.

We also invite all our parents to join us every time, so last year in the U.K. both my parents came along and we did Christmas with both sets of parents. We invited my in-laws this year to country 2, even offered to pay for their planes and fly them back on the 25th so they could also do Christmas with their siblings. They didn’t want to (my boyfriend is disappointed but there’s nothing he can do about it).

My in-laws have now asked us to do Christmas here next year, even saying that they were “booking us early”. But this isn’t about who asks us first to spend Christmas with them, it’s about what we’ve always said we’d do.
They’ve also said that we’ll need to get used to do every Christmas in the U.K. anyway when we have kids... except I’m not planning on stopping to spend Christmas with my family even when we have children (not on the cards in the near future anyway!), I flew quite a lot when I was a kid so I know that traveling with kids is hard but doable.

When we tried to say that next year we’d be with mum in country 1 but they’d obviously be invited to join they got quite upset and said that it wasn’t fair that we were shutting his family out and always spending Christmas with my family instead of them.

I feel that this isn’t the case, we offered for them to join us and they declined but my parents agreed to travel to spend Christmas with us so this isn’t our fault. I do understand that they are upset that they can’t see their son for Christmas though.

How do I navigate this? I don’t want my in-laws to hate me or somehow believe that we’re only traveling until we have children.

Tl:dr: bf and I created a 3 year rotation for Christmas and NY so we can spend Christmas in all our sets of families (my parents are separated and live in different countries and we live abroad from my parents but close to his), his parents are kicking off about it and saying that we always spend Christmas with my family and never his. How do I keep the peace whilst still spending Christmas with my family too?

544,e6gs3f,Shongesabbe,1575550403.0,1,Should I get couples tharapy,"Ok so the full backstory would be a little long so I'll give the quick version.

I've been thinking about getting couples tharapy for a long time. Before the major obstacles where money and time. She is controlling and overly dependent on me.

At its worst I couldn't go over to a friends house for a couple hours without her calling half dozen times begging me to either come home or to go and do something for her. I had actually started to have him pick me up and turn off my phone when I went over. It was only 1-2 times a month and that was the only thing other then work I did. Pass that I was at home with her.

We talked about it and tharapy didnt do tharapy because of money and time issues but things did get a lot better. This was about 4 years ago.

A little over 3 months ago my wife and I witnessed two of our friends get into a domestic. Friend got drunk and beat up her husband. He probably could have ended it if he fought back but he never raised his hand.

This event caused my wife to do a deep downward mental health spiral. Since she has been having lots of anxiety and depression. For a wile there I wasnt really allowed to be around her and since I worked nights meant that I never really saw anyone since I work alone. It was very lonely but I could handle it a lot better then she could.

Now that she is starting to do better she is starting to be overly dependent again and I'm noticing it a lot more then I did before and I've realised how controlling/dependent she still was even 5 months ago. So now I'm thinking about bringing up couples tharapy since I really dont think I can go back to the way things where before. The month of isolation and the other almost 2 months of having a more or less equal if mentally fragile partner where really nice.

I just dont know what I should do since she is still dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety. I dont want to bring this up if it's just going to send her back into a spiral.
I want to support her but I also cant deal with it anymore.

Or should I just go to tharapy by my self and do couples tharapy after she is in a better head space.

My boyfriend of 3 years told me (almost exactly 2 years ago) that he is bisexual. To be clear I do not mind at all that he is bisexual. The way in which he told me was not great though (he told me after we kissed on New Year’s Eve)- honestly just because I think he was drunk and had the courage to at that time.

I reacted poorly at the time, crying asking for more information. This was because the way he presented it I thought he was suggesting we see other people, or that he was already seeing someone else. The next day after I processed that was indeed not what he meant, I wanted to talk about things. He completely shut down- as he does a lot in serious conversations (his family doesn’t talk about their feelings/express emotions much). 

He has been a great support system to me in life especially throughout my bouts of depression and it has really brought us closer together. When he told me he was bisexual he kept insisting he never tried anything with any males and would never cheat on me. I truly believe he would not cheat on me, but honestly I wish he would have tried things with other males before we met, so he knew if this was an interest of his moving forward. 

Unfortunately, I am not open to an open relationship. I feel like this is a lingering thought that may never leave. I do not have strong feelings towards females, so other than asking him I do not know what his thoughts are. My counselor DID NOT put me at ease and said “many men who feel this way sometimes live a double life, one with you and one with a man on the side”. That infuriated me because I do not believe that is true at all. It hurts that someone in a role such as a counselor would put everyone who is bisexual and in a relationship in that category. The sad part is I think she’s gotten into my head and I’m not sure how to shake it. Do I address his feeling about this topic again?

Because im young, and i dont know much about relationships. I recently had my first ever relationship with someone(only been a month), let's call her z. I met her online when i was gaming alot which is before i lost my phone in school(i am using a laptop mostly to go online now). I wouldn't be able to get another one till this christmas. Now to the main topic. z gets mad at me often. But not serious anger.. I'd call it a ""pout"". How do i know? She literally says ""Hmp!"". Now generally i don't get bothered by that beause i think its cute of her but recently.. She starts to get upset with me more and more often. And when she does, she doesn't even like to talk to me about it. She does one of four things.
1. Ignore (never block)
2. Answer with likes
3. really tedious responses like ""...""
4. The usual ""Leave me alone""
Yeah only those FOUR things. No i'm not that mad at her for being like that. I loved her for her attitude in the first place.. But she gets upset at me from the shallowest of things.. That's why i avoid those things at all cost. But sometimes when body and mind is so tired i want to rest.. She get's upset one of those four things just happens before i know it.. The signature signs are emoticons like ""U-U, :<, T- T,"" and the triple dot at the end of her sentences.. Yes she does it so much i'm sure she'll do those if she get's upset.
and really.. I couldn't blame her since her past ex's left her.. I know that it really hurt her so she's being possessive of me(which in turn i am also very possessive of her). There's someone in particular whom she can't move on from.. Which is her first love.. Now no matter how hard i try i wouldn't be able to replace that guy. But that guy left her for someone else.. So i promised to her i would never be the same as her ex. But sometimes.. I think i've tolerated her attitude too much and in turn i don't get time for myself.. Literally.. My daily routine focuses on school and her.. I dont even get that much sleep since i sacrifice it just to make her happy.. And it makes me happy that she is.. But again.. When im just really too tired.. I couldn't even rest because i know she'll get upset again.. I missed spending quality time with her.. But most of the time when i spend my time with her she just watches youtube or netflix. I missed the days where we played games together... She just gets upset at me nowadays.. No.. My love didn't even fade an inch for her.. Even tho she's like that i still love her so much.. I guess i'm asking grown ups on what should i do to make her understand without hurting her that i sometimes need time for myself to rest..

550,e6ggqy,caengber,1575548592.0,1,Keeping tabs with weird expectations,"My partner and I have been together for 4ish months. He’s a great dude and we have a lot of fun together, however we seem to have a big communication issues and I do nottttttt understand it. 

First off, he’s a lot more into “together time” than I am. He’s constantly asking me what I’m doing, and if I don’t say something that’s important to him or a task that needs to be completed he says “ok so when are you going to be over”? Even if we have 0 plans to see each other. An example. Last night I got home around 6 pm from a long ass day and I just needed to chill and relax. He realizes Im home before I was supposed to be and automatically assumed I’d come over and stay the night. I work early mornings (normal start time is 4:30) and packing a bag and driving there to stay up till 10 and not sleep great because he snores just wasn’t going to happen. I said “look I’m busy, i told you yesterday I couldn’t hangout”. And he got upset by this. He steered texting me saying that this is what he hates, I’m so vague all the time about what Im doing or who Im with. 

So I sent him a text (with some attitude I’ll admit) explaining I was exhausted from the day and I need a good nights rest to be prepared for today. He went raído silent and was obviously upset. This behavior happens a lot and I would like advice on how we can break this cycle or how I can communicate more effectively without telling him my every single move, cause come on I find that pretty ridiculous. 

Thanks in advance. 

TDLR: my partner expects me to spend A LOT of time with him and when I say no he gets upset and says I’m too vague about my daily plans. I feel like I have to report back to him every second of every day.",relationship_advice
551,e6gfbx,mattmcswaggins,1575548369.0,12,We’re on a break,"My girlfriend 19F and I 19M have been having issues lately and she suggested we take a break to better ourselves for each other and spend some time apart for 2 weeks exactly. I was a little pissed and upset about it so I needed a boost, so I did a yolo on my Snapchat to get anonymous messages. The first one I got was “hey do you have a girlfriend? Because I kinda wanna fuck around with you” I looked at who viewed it and she was one of the like 6 that had seen it already. The other 5 are people I haven’t seen or heard from in years and aren’t the type of people to say something like that. I know it’s her. I know she’s trying to get me to cheat while we’re on our break and it’s driving me crazy. I want to take it to another level and drop flowers with a note saying “hey I’ve seen you around campus and I think you’re pretty cute. Text me?” Then have a number to a burner phone to see if she does. Then lead her on with a new personality opposite of the bad parts of my personality. Make her fall in love with this new character of mine and then ask her to hangout and meet up. Get her to agree and I’m sitting there waiting. It’s a master scheme that’s gonna take a bit more planning and time but I dont know if I’m going to far and I’m crazy or this is something reasonable as a type of revenge for her trying to catch me cheating. I feel like she tried to do the same to me but I saw through it. So I really wanna do it back just to see what happens. Any advice or feedback is welcomed positive or negative.

553,e6gd4v,jrtolkienthrowaway,1575547995.0,2,Am I (19m) wrong for the way I tried to express my emotions to my girlfriend (20f) during a stressful period?,"Background:

Okay so essentially we have been going through a hard time recently in the relationship.  It was a relatively happy relationship for 2 years, when we argued we would just sit down and hear each other out and compromise, we both made each other very happy and we were open about our feelings.  Although we are university and as finals approached she begun to get more stressed with classes so I have been giving her more time to focus on that but it got to the point where we only talked like a few times a week and she was quite busy at home to message a lot of the time.  So essentially we begun to get more distant and because of that we felt a bit out of that excitement we once had. 

She got more stressed with school continually, to the point she was just overwhelmed and she needed space, but instead of talking to me about anything she said she thought we should be friends which I understand.  But she wanted to have essentially the same sort of relationship without the romantic intimacy.  Although after breaking up with me she kissed me, she held my hand, she hugged me.  Leading up to asking to be friends she was talking about marrying me, like minutes before.

So I was conflicted as she was still being affectionate, but then she said we could get back together if I ""prove myself to her"".  So essentially she told me to try to figure out what she needs to feel the ""spark"" again.  I was taken aback as I dont see relationship building as a guessing game really, not opening up about each others needs.  I accepted it though as I cared about her.

I begun to do a bunch of self reflection and wrote down in a journal to organize my thoughts, I listed how I felt I need to improve as a person, ways I feel I have not shown her respect, ways I felt I was not respected by her, and what sort of needs, wants, and boundaries we want in our relationships.

So I focused on this and we were talking for a week after the conversation, and during this week she kissed me, held me, and she said she still loved me but didn't know what type of love it was.  So I tried my best to hear her out.  I had screwed up and didn't show her the respect she deserved by asking a lot of questions about how she felt, and what she felt I could improve in.  These questions were too overwhelming for her I know, I was so focused on trying to solve everything I had disrespected her emotions.  So I realized that I was not in the mental state to talk to her in a fully respectful manner and she clearly needed a break, so I said we should take 2 weeks away from each other but at the end we promised to have a conversation on a particular date.

I took these two weeks to do as much reflection as I could, I meditated (yes I am weird), and focused a lot on being the best person I can be, while also trying to figure out issues to address in our relationship.

So essentially we went through the two weeks, the only contact was she messaged me to ask if I was alright, and I asked her how she was doing.  She had said she wanted to still say good morning/ goodnight during the break but I felt there was too much tension so I just responded whenever she messaged me and tried to just keep that distance for then.

I had begun to feel confident in myself and prepared to handle the relationship so when the date finally came along I was stressed but was anticipating having this talk.

Essentially what I planned on talking about was, what sort of relationship do we want, by that I mean what are our boundaries, what are our needs, how we feel we need more respect, do we still believe a relationship would work and what effort we need to put in it.  I also was going to ask to extend the break till after finals as I felt trying to talk during an already stressful time would just create conflict.

Situation:

When the day came around I had waited for her where we would talk and she did not come, a bit after the time we were supposed to talk she messaged me and said she wasn't going to come today, was staying at home and hoped we could talk another time.

I was hurt by this so I responded with ""I have to be honest I feel hurt that you did not show up.  I had been putting a lot of effort into preparing for this conversation and trying to improve our relationship and you not showing up because you dont feel like it right now feels a bit disrespectful.  This situation has been pulling my attention away from my school work as you have been expecting me to figure out all your needs and to rebuild this relationship on my own.  I feel as though I am being dragged around without consideration for my emotions and I am hurt.  I understand you need time for your schooling but you had promised me you would discuss this today with me.  I will give you a few more days but I need to have this conversation soon, as I will continue to be stressed and unable to focus on my own schooling until I have this conversation as I want to understand your perspective and needs better.  I feel if it will continue to be you expecting me to chase you without you trying to compromise and work with me, that I am being played with without consideration for my emotions.  I simply want to be able to improve this situation so we can have the best for the both of us.""

Now this message pissed her off, she said it was immature, and rude.  Now I thought I was respectful, but I wanted to understand  why she was upset, so I asked how it had hurt her, the response she gave me was that she had discussed it with her parents and they did not like it.  She didn't give any other reasoning as to why it was hurtful so I apologized but said that I was trying to express how I felt as I believe openness is something we need if we continue our relationship no matter what type of relationship that is.  She then went on and said I need to gain the trust of her family and essentially talk to each person and convince them I am a good person if she was going to talk to me again.

Now this to me felt like a huge slap in the face as I had been trying my best to understand her yet she didn't really ever talk to me about what her issues were with me.  It's also sad because we had a happy, open relationship until we got distant a week or so before the whole situation.  And I do understand it definitely was not perfect, but we had chemistry.

So am I am asshole for how I handled this, and feel free, if needed, to please ask questions, if you need more information about a particular thing, I will answer.

Also at this point we are not talking, she's asking her family about having a friendship with me, but honestly at this point I feel as though it is a hopeless situation to try to pursue any further.  I do care about her but I feel she is a bit immature for avoiding any confrontation and relying on her family to essentially make the decisions for her.  Although I may be wrong.

Edit: just one thing I missed, her initial response to the message was ""I am not responsible for your feelings, or your schooling."". Which its like yeah, she isnt, but is she not responsible for actions and how they affect me?",relationship_advice

My dad is super religious, he often donates to the muslim church (sorry don't know the word) and I couldn't describe it but he has true faith in Allah, it's like if he was living for it.

As for myself, i've never really questionned myself but our dad taught us the religion, how to pray and other stuff.
But all I was doing was following what he was asking.

We have to pray 5times per day and it feels like it takes all our time. Whenever I do something i have to check if I have time before the next pray. When we don't do it together I lie to my dad and tell him I did it.

Recently he was out for work for a whole month and i never felt so good. I had no more pression on me.
He's home again and since (1week) that I haven't pray yet and he is starting to get really mad because it is ""mandatory""

I DO NOT HAVE FAITH IN ANY SORT OF GOD. I'm an atheist faking being muslim to his parents.

I want to tell them the truth but I don't know how and when I should do it.

555,e6gc0y,ThrowRAPaxilSux,1575547808.0,2,I think antidepressants ruined my (31m) and my boyfriends (21m) a loving relationship of almost 4 years,"Sorry this is kinda long, I may just be distraught and blindsided. But also I think it's important to have the details of our relationship to see how the antidepressants may have impacted it.

THE BACKGROUND:

Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 4 years. Yes, if you do the math he was 18 when we met. I wasn't looking for a relationship with someone younger. I was actually looking for someone more mature after a few failed relationships. I even had the filter on the dating app for people over 22 (I was 27 at the time). He changed his age on his profile, indicating to me he was looking for someone older. I did ask him about this and he did freely admit was 18 and was looking for someone more mature as he didn’t find anyone his age to be on his maturity level. I didn’t think grabbing a coffee together would hurt. We just clicked, we had so many of the same interests, same hobbies, liked same foods, and had same passions. And it was true he was seemingly more mature and knew what he wanted out of life much more than anyone I had dated before.

We continued to date, and a few month later moved in with me, mostly at his behest. I didn't object he was practically living there already as he would come after work to talk, hangout, watch movies, cuddle and y'know. I again was hesitant, but at this point we were really falling in love. Also I wasn’t clear on his family life, I didn’t know if it was chaotic or worse abusive. Later that season he had car trouble and invited his Mom and Stepdad over to look at it. This was the first time I met them it was a bit awkward obviously but they seemed very normal, not unlike my own parents. I’ve since seen them a lot, meeting for birthdays, holidays, and BBQs. And we got along very well, I liked them very much and I can tell they liked me and thought we were good together. My BF told me recently that his mom likes me and thinks I’m good for him because I am very stable and loving. I later found out he was carrying a lot of trauma from his parents divorce (cheating) that sent his childhood into chaos. I think his is why he was so eager to leave and have a stable relationship.

At this point he was working his high school job and looking to his future. I worked in a professional field and he was interest in the same fields as well.  I already knew he was very smart, one of the reasons I was falling in love with him. I was able to get him into an intern position at a former job of mine. I still had a few friends there including one of my best friends and I knew he was more talented than many full time employees there. As a side benefit, his car was dead. And this new job only a few minutes away from my job. We commuted together. The downside is this job was much closer into the city than where we lived. So it was a long exhausting commute.

Also at this time I had enough money saved up for a downpayment on a house and he had now been making decent money as well. My BF was on the same page as me that he wanted to move into the city to make everything easier, our commute, seeing our friends, going on adventures, etc.  We also wanted a companion for my dog whom is often left alone during the day. So we found a breeder and got another one a similar breed. We really fell in love with the dog and it brought us so much joy as doggie daddies. We'd go on a lot of doggie meet ups, go to the dog beach, or just walk them to get coffee on the weekends.

Fast forward a bit, I mistakingly take a new opportunity that turned out to be a lot more stress. I felt a lot of weight on my shoulders. I must admit during this time I was under a lot of stress and was not as good of a partner to my BF as I could have been. I would sometimes be angry and distraught and would retreat to the bedroom and cut off communication. Or generally just grumpy around the house. That would go in phases, there would be some good days and some bad days.

I quit that job and returned to my previous job that welcomed me with open arms (and a even little more pay). Over the next couple years and thru a few other connections of mine, my BF is a professional in the field, he's almost making as much as I am at a Senior level despite being 10 years younger. And he deserves it he's highly talented.

THE SITUATION:

I was feeling great, It's the best it's ever been. The commute was half of what it used to be, so it wasn't so tiring when we got home. And the work was not very stressful. This left us as a couple a lot more time and energy to play around with things and just enjoy life. We invested more in the house and it's about then that we began to take a lot of trips together, either with friends or just alone the two of us. Only a couple months ago, he gave me a birthday card where he wrote ""I can't wait to see where the next few years take us"".

That was all until he began taking antidepressants (Paxil). This was about 3 months ago. He used one of those online services where they video conference with you and write you a prescription. With that be began seeing an online therapist as well. He was never a person I or others would consider depressed or anxious. Only time I noticed it was when we were in a crowded store he would be uncomfortable. I did begin to see a change in him he, was more open when we talked, less afraid to speak his mind. I liked that and thought it was a positive improvement. I felt like this was a small but good improvement to our relationship. During this we're still traveling and having romantic dinners together, hanging out with friends, and everything seemed great. He would even be more open to friends about our relationship when he went out. Holding my hand and telling them how stable our relationship was.

A few weeks ago he upped his dosage. He seemed to stop having a lot of interest in many things I thought he liked. That's when I began to noticed more changes that I would consider erratic and less like himself in a bad way. One example, is that he was working a freelance project and the company did not get him the contract despite the deadline closing. He wrote a really long ranting email to the company.. He sent it to me to read before he sent it. I told him to just say ""I'm sorry, I'm unavailable"" and not burn bridges. He ended up sending down a toned down version of the ranting email that said he quit. But after talking with the company ended up taking the project anyway, even though he was so against it the previous night. Very unlike the person I've known for 4 years. He's usually extremely measured and less prone to impulse than me.

Also during this time he started drinking more than usual at home. And when out with friends he would drink to excess. To the point where he would tell me he thought he was blackout. Again, he has usually been very measured in these things. Also he was extra horny, we were be having sex 3x more than usual and cuddling more as well.

Within the last few weeks, he had started mentioning having an ""open relationship"". We had discussed this briefly in the past. So it didn't surprise me that he brought this up while being extra horny. I told him I was ok with this, because I felt our relationship was so solid. We had a few threesomes and some other encounters with another couple during the course of our relationship. And I always felt our relationship was stronger after these. Plus maybe I want to do this in the future. And he was quite young when we first got together, he lost his virginity to me. About a week later he told me he was on Grindr and planned to meet up with someone later that week. I again was supportive of this. The day came, he went out. He told me it would be a ""late night"". I basically said ""no, worries, have fun, be safe"". He ended up spending the night at this person's place. This was a weekday. So he came home and got ready for work with me and went to work. It was a very normal day. This was a Friday after work we decided to have drinks with some friends. We ended up at a bar near our house. He had a lot of drinks at this point. He took me aside and said this guy lived right around the corner and could he go. I said sure. Our work friends noticed he disappeared and noted it was weird that he didn't say goodbye. Anyway I hang out a little more with my friends. And go home. I figured he would probably not be home again. The next morning I text him to ask how he his. He says he's very hungover (so was I). I decided to give him space and don't text him much. I wanted to get him get this energy out without me being nagging or interrupting. He's out all day again with this person. I ask him at night if he'll be home. He says yes, but doesn't end up coming home.

He returns home in the morning, he's sort of tearful. He tells me that he's been a dick. I say, I missed him and that it's ok just be better about it in the future. He's still exhausted and hung over from this weekend bender. So he crashes on the bed. I hang out with him a bit and attempt to cuddle up. I leave him alone in bed and go about my Sunday routine. Feed the dogs, make coffee, and clean up a bit. After a few hours he ends up joining me and again it seems back to normal. We even do a few minor home improvement projects together. Later in the night I go up to bed to watch Netflix and he's working on the aforementioned freelance project.

When he gets to bed, I turn off the TV and very calmly mention that I was unhappy with how this weekend went. And I asked him why he thought that. He said because he didn't communicate with me. Yes, that was the major reason. But also the seemingly unhealthy was he had been treating himself. Spending 3 nights in a row at a strangers, drinking to excess etc. At this point he begins to break down. Starting hysterically crying and convulsing. Saying things like  “I don’t feel anything”, “I have no inner voice”, and “nothing is satisfying”. Followed by finally ""I'm not sure if I love you anymore"". At this point I lose it and begin crying as well.  Because I did not see this coming at all. He mentioned he feels “brain zaps” which I later learned is a withdrawal symptom of antidepressants, as he didn't take them the 2 days he was away from the house. We both try to calm down.

In the morning, I lose it again going about the morning routine because the thought of losing him so suddenly hurt so much. Everything I see around the house is a memory of something we did together. He comes down and tells me he's going to speak with him mom he goes to his car and does this. When he comes back about 40 mins later he tells me he spoke with his mom, his dad, and his best friend and has decided ""we're not right for each other."" He packs some stuff and leaves. I speak with his mom and tell her what has led up to this and how he's been acting not like himself lately. She's a nurse so I'm glad that he is with her.

A few days later we text and he said he'd like to come with his mom to pack some things and to talk. When they come, his mom is crying an immediately embraces me. We sit down and talk. He reiterates wanting some space and I reiterate how much I love him and how I was blindsided by this. He mentions a few instances our relationship or some flaws I have. All I feel pretty minor and things I'm very willing to work on and have made progress towards even before this. I think he expected me to be very angry and to slam doors or something. I really just said how much I loved and cared for him. And that this was still his house and to please come by whenever. We decided to work out sharing custody of the dogs when he gets settled at his moms. This heart to heart went well, even though all 3 of us where in tears by the end. I offer to help him move some of his stuff. He says no, that I should go lay down. I do, I hear the dogs barking and figure I should round them up so they are not in the way. I go down and I catch him sitting in a chair bawling uncontrollably with him mom comforting him.

We all hug goodbye, and he mentions he would like to come back later this week to pack few more things and talk more. In the interim, I have been texting with him a bit to check in. We are texting just like always with our inside jokes and deepish conversations about how well feel. He seems a little bit more aloof than normal but generally engaged and offering up tidbits of his emotions. He mentioned that he feels pretty dull emotionally, and is really only forming emotional bonds with his mom's animals, not people. He also said that he is working with his doctor to changes his meds. But also thinks he might have some deeper psychological problem beyond anxiety. (BPD, Bipolar, Schizophrenia). But living with him for 4 years I never say any sign of that, seems more like hypochondria to me. He's clearly extremely highly functioning to achieve so much at a young age, I know he's very much respected by his friends and colleagues.

I did a lot of research into antidepressants lately, and I could see he's suffering many side effects (weakness & drowsiness, changes in sex drive & ability, alcohol cravings & drinking to excess, mood swings). All of which can be exacerbated by lack of sleep and drinking. And I also found a study of people who are on SSRIs in long term relationships: ""The results showed that SSRIs had a significant impact on the feelings of love and attachment towards the partner especially in men"". I do understand that he's young and our relationship was such a whirlwind. But these seemingly sudden changes I can only put down to the meds.

My question is how I go forward? We're still in communication. And I still check in with his mom separately from time to time. I refuse to believe a 4 year relationship can evaporate out of the blue. With no fight or even frustration for such a long time. It's taking a lot to not just spill my heart out the him and tell him how much I love him and I would do anything to have it back. Instead I'm just trying to be the person he's know for 4 years when we talk, just be that rock. I don't think the meds would allow him to ever under.",relationship_advice

557,e6gbmq,johnnybli2,1575547736.0,1,Why would someone pursue me for a relationship for months then just decide they don’t want one?,"I don’t understand her at all. Literal months of pushing to meet me when I basically had very little interest. I got really odd vibes off her and we were at a distance so I didn’t really want to meet her. I also had confidence issues at the time. 

But then I finally decide I’ll meet her. She had met someone else, then that broke off and she came back to me. So I figured it would be okay for me to meet her as she seemed really keen. (Even tho I now realise she was talking to me while seeing him). 

So we meet. Go on a date. It’s amazing. She’s so outgoing and she seems to really like me. Wants me to come back and stay the night. I have a great feeling and then boom, don’t want a bf. Which honestly confused the shit out of me. But she wants to keep seeing me. She says it’s too late now and it’s a shame as she’s leaving. 

We keep dating. She sends the mother of all mixed signals. I fall for her hard. She essentially tells me we’re taking it slow. She says I make her happy and she misses me and she stays back longer to see me. I ask her if she’s been sleeping with anyone else and she says no. 

Then I’m obsessed and immature and crazy and anger inducing. I obviously get a bit upset at this as I’m not like that at all and I was just trying to be good to her like she had been saying she wanted me to be. It gets a bit heated and then we don’t talk for a week. I try to apologise but she ignores me. Won’t talk to me for 3 months. 

Then suddenly she wants to be mates again and now I’m crazy for not wanting to be just friends. And now I have to go no contact. 

I can’t get this girl out of my head. It’s fucked with me so much I just don’t understand it. 

Any ideas? Thanks",relationship_advice
558,e6g9zc,swatchyswatcher-,1575547461.0,1,FB opening up old friendship scars (long post),"I had a memory on fb pop up showing a comment from a former internet friend. I had dropped the rope with her after 8 years of friendship and stopped messaging them everyday. And after a year of no contact from said person I deleted them and blocked them on all social media.  I contacted them I think a year later because I had a dream they had died and they had said “I’m glad to hear from you” after I had expressed that I was concerned, I didn’t respond back but again I wasn’t going to pick the rope up again. 

I’m not sure when I unblocked them but they have in turned blocked me now (seeing this on fb) It kinda brought up a sadness in me as I kinda miss that friendship but I don’t miss feeling like a second class friend to them. It was petty things like them making art for other people’s birthdays but for my birthday I would never get anything.  I explained my hurt to someone and they said it sounds like I valued the friendship more then they did so I dunno 

Another example They’d Skype with other friends but not me, I would send letters but never got anything in return. I never got any validation that they cared? They even used to say to me “thank you for not comparing our friendship to others” even when I was hurt they didn’t acknowledge me in our online fandom communities ect

If that makes sense - it’s been 2-3 years now but I still miss them???  


It then made me look up another online ex friend #2 who stopped being my friend by ghosting me. We had been friends for over a year and when I visited the states she came and saw me in NYC we again used to talk every day but Because I’d called her boyfriend a few choice things because he was being unsympathetic to her pain at a convention they were cosplaying at. She went and told him and he unfriended me on everything so I said to her “hey maybe don’t tell me things about you and BF since it’s not my place to get involved if you’re gonna run and tell him what I said. it’s been over a year since that happened and again I’m mad but also a little hurt.

559,e6g9vn,throwawaymayor13,1575547445.0,1,I've been in love with someone that I dont think I was ever attracted to for over 10 years,"I know that sounds goofy, it sounds silly, it sounds like I'm a horrible person. 

Let me start from the beginning. I met my partner over 10 years ago on a dating website.  I thought ""oh wow, what a beautiful smile!"" When I saw her first picture. I read her profile from top to bottom (well before just swiping) and decided to send her a message. I was unaware she was actually online when I looked at her profile and she saw that I was looking. She looked at mine, 20 minutes later of online chatting i called her. 

Our first date was 3 days later. She was so interesting and sweet and fun.  I just couldn't get enough of this women. I wanted to spend every moment with her. To the point I moved in with her a little over a month later (her idea). It was great but I at the same time felt this missing spark. 

I have no plans what so ever to leave her. I have been happy with her for over a decade. We have had some amazing times and I still love being with her just as much maybe even more. 

However, this is where it gets interesting I've never really found her attractive. Pretty, beautiful? Yes. But I can only think of a few times I found her attractive in the physical sense.

560,e6g82c,sagoooo,1575547160.0,1,(M20) Advice on asking out a girl from college (F22),"So, there's this girl from class (F22) I've had a crush on since pretty much the first day of class, and I (M20) decided last year to ask her out by the time we graduated. Well, there's about a week until then, and I'm well aware I waited too long. We're in a technical program together, so mostly everyone in our class is fairly close/good friends, the way that coworkers would be. So, I guess my question would be how to ask her out by the end of next week without it being weird/out of the blue. She probably doesn't know that I'm interested in her, and I can't really tell if she's interested in me either, but we are pretty good friends. I'm pretty shy so I'd say flirting/dropping hints is out of the question, especially considering I've never even dated anyone before. I'm thinking of getting her number soon, but I wouldn't know what to do afterward. What's the best way to go about this?",relationship_advice
561,e6g7t0,Vexettt,1575547111.0,2,How do I [M25] do what is best for me in this situation with my ex[F20]?,"Me [M25] Been with my [F20] ex-girlfriend for 2 years now, she came to me 4 days ago suddenly telling me that we should seperate (we lived together) and that we couldn't live together. I was crying and asking why, and she gave me an explanation, which actually sadly made sense, that she was overseen and that I changed her personality, by somewhat manipulating her. On top of that I didn't do well with her family and friends. I recognized these behaviours and really noticed that I did indeed do those things. I went home to dig deep that day on how to fix them, and I came with a solution and really actually knew how to fix them. What annoyed me was that she never said anything like ""if this pattern of behavior continues, I won't be able to continue""

So I returned to my girlfriend and asked for another chance since I would be able to change them with time (i know no one can tell), however she said no and this time said she needed some time apart and she needs to form her own personality. This confused me but also broke my heart, it was a different reason from the first ones, but the fact that we were over made me so scared and I had to puke.

The next two days goes by, I can't sleep, can't eat, constant feeling of anxiety and unease as if I have to do something constantly(is this normal?)

So yesterday was our last day, I helped her pack her things and she left, she was crying many times and so was I, the whole situation was very sad, and she said once she changed and I have changed we might find eachother in the future, but also told me not to expect anything. I said in a cold tone, that I would do what's best for me, and that torturing myself over someone who didn't stay with me is quite pointless. Her reaction was quite different and she got even more sad about that. She said she still loves me and feels as if I am the one, she just needs some time to find herself, since I influenced her so much in a direction that she's not herself.

I need to go no-contact, I really need to get over her, so I can function again. I see her everywhere, and associate the whole aprtment with her. I deleted all our images, unfollowed on instagram, made her invisible in snapchat and facebook. Also this is NOT a way to get her back, I really want to move forward, and if she decides to ask me to get her back, I think I'll reject, I won't risk anything, the way I feel these days SUCK. Constant anxiety, tense, not being able to eat or sleep. Also the anxiety, I don't know why I have it, I'm constantly shaking.

563,e6g74k,psychonaut4020,1575546997.0,1,I[22M] think my girlfriend[19F]has a drinking problem.,"So I'll just get straight to it with a tiny fact about me. I'm a recovering opiate addict. I've been clean for a long long time and don't ever see myself touching that stuff again. I believe I've moved past it at this point. Me and my girlfriend have been together for a decent amount of time now. We know each other extremely well. We know our moods and just about everything we're gonna say to each other. I can definitely say that we're both in love with each other. But for about the past month I've been noticing her drinking quite a bit. Not just when she's out with friends but when she leaves my house and gets home at 1130 on a Tuesday she'll get drunk. She has drank at work once as well. And drinking at work is absolutely not acceptable and I was pretty angry about it because she could lose her job drinking at work. I can tell that she's drinking every single day. Her personality changes to a very noticeable degree when she drinks. She's usually very quite like me and she gets way more talkative and her voice definitely changes. 

I am legitimately worried for her and I want to help her and be there for her. Mainly because that's what helped me get clean and I wouldn't have been able to do it without the support from those closest to me. I Most likely wouldn't leave her because of her drinking. But maybe that's because I know where she's coming from. And since I know where she's coming from I know that that will not help things get better. At least not right away. This girl is the one person I've been in a relationship with that I actually see a future with. So I do definitely think this is something worth fixing. I'm just wondering what to do. Especially since the approach that worked with me (tough love) is not something that would work with her. I've considered asking her to go to a meeting with me. I go to AA since there's seemingly no more NA meetings near me. Idk if this is the right sub for this so I apologize if that's the case.

566,e6g66m,GoatsEatToast,1575546845.0,1,Is it worth waiting for my ex? Am I moving on too quickly?,"Hey. I already expect most of you to say that it isn’t worth waiting for an ex, but I guess I just needed to vent somewhere and ask for advice as well. My feelings are all over the place and I don’t know how to truly feel about this.

My ex (18M) and I (18F) broke up about a month ago. We were only together for 2 months, but I considered him my first “real” boyfriend. I think I grew so attached to him because of how physically affectionate we were with each other. I’m not going to go into detail on what led to our breakup, but he was the one that wanted to. He said he wanted to “focus more on school and loving himself before loving anyone else,” and I understood because I did notice he was struggling with that. We also weren’t able to see each other often because we go to different schools and our schedules often conflicted on weekends. He told me to wait for him, and I was willing to at first, but now not so much. He also told me that he still wanted to talk everyday. For like 1-2 weeks, we were able to keep conversations going, but now his replies are like a day apart.

Over the past month, I felt really sad about it. I didn’t show it at first, but it started to hit me gradually. I’d literally come home from school, lock myself in my room, and listen to sad playlists in the dark. I’d pass by places we went to or talk about things we did, and always express how I missed it so much. My friends would constantly hear me talk about him and what I could’ve done differently, and I started feel like a burden to them because of that. I know me and him weren’t together for long, but it was definitely one of the happiest times I’ve had in a while. I felt my best, both emotionally and physically. I just felt so much more confident. I know he was sad as well because of sad songs he’d post on his Instagram stories; it was almost as if he was indirecting me with them, too. Honestly, that made me feel more emotional about everything...ugh. Anyways, as I mentioned, we still did talk after the breakup, but it decreased a lot recently. Maybe he’s moved on, maybe he’s super busy, I don’t know. 

I actually don’t mind too much because there is another guy I’ve been speaking to. I met him a while ago, but we recently got in touch again and he’s been super nice to me. It’s kinda obvious that he’s into me since he’s always complimenting me (on Snapchat, I send selfies for streaks lol) and he’s just overall my type. I did tell him I was feeling sad one day because I was thinking of my ex, and he did back off a bit with his messages. I don’t want him to just be a rebound, but I’m slowly starting to like him too. I’m also starting to realize some of the red flags I’ve seen with my ex, and it’s helping me move on faster. I don’t want to jump into another relationship right away, but I can’t help how I feel about this new guy. Though, a part of me is still stuck about wanting to wait and see if anything happens between me and my ex...

569,e6g41b,pleasedtobepink,1575546483.0,1,Obsessive Ex - What do I do?,"
I’m unsure of when I need to be more worried. I am easily worried/anxious. I broke up with a guy about 4 months ago. He raped me after I broke up with him, and was generally a crazy/unstable  person. He’s 10 years older than me. I left him because 1) He went to jail for violence and wouldn’t change his behavior (he would still easily get into fights with strangers or the police) 2) He was a sex addict I guess? And would have frequent hook ups with various women who he had just met.



I was stupid to have been with him in the first place, and had some serious personal issues going on. When I tried to leave him he held me down and forced himself on me, then later threatened to kill himself.   He told me that what we had was special, and could take a decade to get over (we were together for a year). I found this alarming. I really wanted to just move on from him, and the life that I was building at the time. I moved to a neighboring state, about 3 1/2 hours from where he lives, for a fresh start. 





I don’t want anything to do with him. When I was still with him he got thrown in jail.  I had his two children with me. and we were all out of town, so I paid his bail. He was to pay me back. After we split I just paid the bill, and didn’t bother to speak to him about the money. Clean break. 




I got a call from a bail company last week asking me if I wanted to bail him out. He was in jail again. Shocker. I said “he’s not my problem anymore” and that was that. Yesterday I guess he called my mom?!? He also called me twice in a row but I blocked him. It was from a different number (I have him blocked on everything). I’m just worried he will try to find me. I haven’t spoken to anyone about my worries. I don’t want to be dramatic or make people worry. I know I can be anxious. I had nightmares about the rape for a couple of months, it still causes me depression. Sometimes  I cry it out and sometimes I drink to numb it. I still wake up in the middle of the night in fear with flashbacks and  unable to sleep. It sort of cycles through how severe it all feels. Lately, it has been very depressing. 


I don’t know at what point to be worried. I don’t know what I would do if I got an unexpected visit. He can be very aggressive, quick and tricky, and I can be a “freezer”. 



I don’t know what to do. I feel like maybe he can’t even find me. Maybe it would be too much work. But I know he gets bored and that his kids are leaving. So he will have more free time for the month.  He travels all the time for work so 3 1/2 hours is nothing. So I don’t know. He doesn’t know exactly where I am. He knows which state. Maybe he remembers which city. I’m so stressed out. I have no one to talk to about this. 


Part of me feels like maybe I should not have blocked his number so quickly. Maybe I could have monitored what was going on. Is he angry that I left him in jail or is he calling me about something else? He’s extremely manipulative, so I decided to block him. I don’t know. I’m so worried.

We got together after he had confessed his feeling for me as well as I did for him and we made wonderful memories together along the way. About a couple months of being together I started to notice some things that really began to bother me personally. We love to play video games together and have fun however, on the couple times that we played together, I began to realize that he began to become highly stressed and frustrated whenever he would loose in a game. Including screaming and yelling at the game, I know this is normal to some gamers out there but he has told me he's broken countless keyboards and punched the wall many times. I have heard him slam his keyboard once while we were in a call and it really frightened me while he was also yelling. At one point, we were playing in a duals game and when I managed to land a shot on him he just out of the blue cussed me out. He is taking meds for his behavior as he has told me before that he gets angry a lot and tries to take prescription meds but it still doesn't get away from my huge worry and concern, he also feels very depressed of himself to suicide and has hurt himself and that itself gets me very stressed as I've personally seen some unforgettable suicidal things concerning my family. Im a bit afraid of what the future would come to us if he were to still lash out like that, I know full well I would put myself infront of him to stop him if he were in a situation to want to hurt himself or something else and it could result in one or both of us being injured. Communication for him is also very lacking, he has told me before hand that he is very much radio silent but it really makes me feel lost and left behind. We have talked about it before but he only mentioned it being a bad habit. I know full well communication is the key to a relationship and that's what I want to do, sometimes we've gone almost three weeks without contact. I want to be able to understand him as I have a family member who has full Autism and I love him with all my heart so I want to know what I can do and what we could talk it through about that won't hurt both of us. I probably sound rude and I apologize deeply, I've never been with someone who has Autism in a relationship before and I want to make sure everything is okay and I'm not doing anything wrong on my part. I just want to know from a point of others how they would feel and how I should come forward and talk about this to him or help him in any way.

573,e6g322,ThrowRA_jfoiwej,1575546310.0,3,I [26M] confessed to my girlfriend [28F] of four years that I look at other girls,"My problem is that I look at other girls. It's unconscious. Anywhere I am, my eyes are tuned to look at women's faces. And when I see a beautiful girl, I follow her with my eyes, but never stare. Always drop eye contact when they look at me. The problem is that I have a girlfriend. And after I catch myself looking at a pretty face, I feel guilt and am disgusted with myself. Like I'm cheating.

I have always been like this, even with my past girlfriends. It never came to adultery, but I feel like I always wanted the attention of more than just a woman I'm with. As I see it, it's like a proof to me, that I am wanted. And not just by my girlfriend that may be delusional about me (here I stop comprehending my thought process so can't properly articulate). I need the *outer* attention because I feel like other women are not obligated to give it to me (if that makes sense). I value compliments from other girls more than ones from my girlfriend because they *choose* to give it to me. It takes them an extra step to show me attention. If that doesn't make sense I'll try to explain in the comments. 

So pretty much the problem is in my head. I'm always emotionally drained, self-hating, low self-esteem. I've tried to not look at other girls. But at this point I do it unconscious. And how can I not look? As I live my life, I will meet women. I can't block them from my life. So this is not the answer. 

This goes a step further. For example we have a new girl on our floor at work. She is pretty. But even if she weren't, she would catch my eye. Now I want to get to know her. Not romantically, just as a coworker, as a person. And I am always lost for words when she's walking by. This gives me anxiety that I can't get her attention.

Me and my girlfriend had a fight and she told me she suspects that I'm hiding something from her. I told her about the girls I see on the public transport and on the streets and about this one girl at work. Just all the truth I was hiding from her for years. I can't imagine how hard it was for her to hear this. I don't know how to comfort her now and what would be the right path to take. I just want her to be happy. Even if that means that we have to part.

I love my girlfriend and appreciate her. I just can't help myself.

I understand this is a fucked up situation. I feel like I am mentally ill. I am arranging a visit to a psychotherapist.

578,e6fww0,idunnorntbh,1575545227.0,1,My (25m) ex girlfriend (20f) ended it for an ex. We're in each other's lives a lot and were really compatible. Help!,"Hi Reddit, I always imagined that my first post would be a long one so here goes. My ex girlfriend ""Emily"" (20f) and I (25m) go to college together and are in each other's classes. 

Around three or four months ago we began talking one night at a social event and hit it off really well, just as friends at that point. I was aware previous to the night that she was or had been involved for two or three months with a guy that doesn't go to college and from all that I've heard is a bit of a loser, let's call him Steve(24m). I behaved  respectfully towards her and as such didn't attempt anything other than a brief hug at the end of the night. We both commented that it was a great evening and went our separate ways.

Fast forward to a few weeks later where I've found out that Emily has broken up with Steve and is now single. I should add here that I've heard from other sources that Steve was actually a bit of an a**hole to Emily, being disrespectful to her, influencing her  to try illicit drugs, not being very emotionally supportive in general. Just not a positive person to have in your life.

Okay so Emily on the other hand is completely different to Steve. She's academic, intelligent and has an incredible drive to succeed. With myself being an older student she  really stood out to me with her intelligence and our conversations were just on another level. I've dated around before and I've been in two previous long term relationships with the last one ending amicably after three years, and I can honestly say that I've never connected with someone emotionally and intellectually as I did with Emily. 

So anyway around the time I heard of her breakup I'd scheduled to go away for a week or so during a break period. While I was away we texted back and forth sporadically  and I'll have to admit that the messages became somewhat personal at that point. Around one week after I returned from being away we met up and I took her out to lunch. I was mindful of her recent breakup three or four weeks prior and so chose at that point to tread carefully to avoid being a rebound. 

So four or five weeks post breakup and a week of messaging back and forth after the date and seeing each other in classes things began to develop quickly. We were spending at least two nights together a week and having absolutely fantastic sex. We spoke about our expectations of the relationship and I think that our communication couldn't be faulted.

Things gradually developed over a month and a half to two months and it was honestly really really good. It had all of the hallmarks of a relationship with a lot of potential. We communicated well, we had the same ideals, similar goals and aspirations and a similar outlook on life in general.  I met her family and her siblings and we all got along really well. She confided in me a few of her own personal issues and I in her and from what I could tell we both really connected from that.

So that brings me to two weeks ago where everything disappeared. I  invited to a family event by Emily and her family, which I gladly accepted. There was alcohol that evening and Emily had had a few drinks. I unfortunately had to leave early as I was feeling unwell, so I headed back to Emily's place early without a second thought as it was only a family event and I knew she would be looked after.

I expected Emily's parents and siblings back at her house a few hours later so I went to sleep and woke up when they arrived, without Emily.

I asked where Emily was and her mother told me that she was just finishing packing up at the venue and would be along shortly. I thought not much of it and went to lay back down. I heard a car arrive out the front of the house a short time later and I heard drunk Emily with someone else. I looked out the front door and saw Emily in the arms of Steve and they were kissing. I walked out the front and said something along the lines of it ruining my night. I had a very brief conversation with her and I told her we were finished. She told me that I had to go and when I asked if Steve would be staying she said yes.

I drove home and immediately went no contact and blocked her on everything. She sent me two text messages the next day, one asking if I'd arrived home safely and another apologising for what had happened. I didn't reply.

I contacted her yesterday to exchange some belongings and we organised to do that today. We sat and spoke for around half an hour about recent exam marks and plans for the upcoming college break we are on. I gathered that she was still seeing Steve and I didn't really ask much about that. I'm fairly resilient when it comes to this sort of thing and I behave and think rationally and logically under pressure, so seeing her today didn't effect me too badly. I was calm and well composed.


So here's the thing Reddit. I am going to be at college with this girl a few years from this point. We socialise with the same people and generally are around each other enough to notice. I honestly really liked this girl and she had just about every good quality about her that I would like in a partner and that is one of the biggest issues that I have within myself. I've processed things over the past two weeks fairly well and like I said I can handle being around her not a problem. Looking at it objectively I suppose I was a rebound, though when I saw her today she immediately asked me for a hug and it lasted for a while. Like I said I'm not new to dating and I've got no problems meeting girls. I'm fairly confident and I wouldn't hesitate in asking for a girls number, but Emily is honestly going to be on my mind for a while. Ultimately what should I do? I wouldn't even think about chasing her or trying to attract her back at this point, I respect myself too much. But the last few months were unbelievable, and I can honestly reflect back with a clear mind about how and why everything was so good.

TLDR: Girl I was seeing used me as a rebound maybe? We're around each other in our lives a lot, what should I do?",relationship_advice

581,e6fv8x,desperation_man,1575544939.0,3,A person I thought was a friend is starting to ruin my life,"Hello. Throwaway account here.


I've been with my wife for around 8 years and we have a young son together who is my world.

Me and my son both have a hobby that allows us to bond outside of the house and during this hobby I met a woman that I've become close with.

At first I figured it was a friendship. We messaged a bit via Facebook and and then it started to get more involved, she was having a tough time at home with her husband and kids, wanted a divorce and I've been very supportive of this.

I'm aware that I've done wrong, but sexual things were discussed and I never directed those things towards her, however she did towards me.

Anyway. The conversations moved into dodgy grounds and she eventually came out and told me she had feelings for me.

At this point I tried to move away from those kinds of conversations involving her feelings towards me, I was still trying to be a friend but at the same time she was still pushing for more.

I eventually told her nothing could happen. I was semi-happily married and even if I was completely miserable I could never leave my son.

Then one fateful night me and her were out doing this hobby and she kissed me. I rejected her and she flipped out

Over the last few months I haven't been able to sleep or eat properly due to the anxiety of my wife finding out.

Because I'm a decent guy or at least try to be, I took the blame for it all, again over messenger, to make her feel better about the rejection. However she couldn't accept it and kept taking digs and arguing about it daily.

Anyway. Down to the point of the post. I asked her after I told her nothing would happen, if she was likely to forward the messages to my wife (out of context they look extremely incriminating) and she said no.

However

This last week has been the most anxiety filled of my life. She has blocked me on every single platform after spending ages insulting my wife. She won't speak to me.

 I need help with this.

I'm not pretending that I'm perfect or not at fault at all. The 'friend' latched onto me when I was at a low point in my life and when my marriage was going to shit. Since all of this. I've realised how much I love my wife and that petty arguements aren't important.",relationship_advice
582,e6fu93,IndyLife317,1575544769.0,1,Just moved with my girlfriend and dog. Having trouble adjusting and miss (part of) my old life,"Hi all. So as the title says I just moved with my girlfriend and dog to somewhere new. We had been living with my family a couple months while we found jobs which bought us to our new location. However we are now just getting all settled in at our new place and I’m starting to realize how sad I am. 

To start off,
We moved from the Midwest to where my parents were even though I had a good job and friends there. We moved as a way to get out of the Midwest and to get away from the same old same old. I grew up in the place we moved from and nothing seemed new and exciting anymore. My girlfriend and I were also wanting a new start after some things we have been working through that has caused some stress in our lives.

We then moved to my parents while we both found jobs in new locations. I loved those couple months we lived there. I had temporary work there, met some friends of my brother and enjoyed being around my family. It was a stress free couple of months.

Now my girlfriend and I have both started new jobs, our relationship seems to the point where our old problems may sometimes still linger but not an everyday problem like it used to be and we just completed our move.

However, something doesn’t feel right to me. I don’t know if it’s because i miss my old job and friends in the Midwest (even though I really didn’t the months I was living with my family)? the start of a new job in a new location? Worried about meeting new friends? I’m confused about what I feel and why?

I definitely know I’m homesick and going to miss the life we were living with my family and being able to see my parents, brother and sister every day but it feels like more is eating away at me than just being homesick. I feel really sad and it’s taking a toll on me.

We have only been here for 5 days so it definitely has been a short period of time without me giving it much of a chance so far.
I just would like any advice on how to deal with what I’m feeling or if anyone else has dealt with it in a similar situation as me. Thanks

I know a part of me knows it’s ridiculous but what other reason could you have to add 2 attractive young girls other than you fancy them and want to keep in contact. Is this not the modern day equivalent of asking for a girls number? 

I just find it so suspicious, I asked him about it and he said it was nothing and followed them for no reason but I don’t believe that. I couldn’t see him asking 2 40 year old men to follow him on Twitter, or 2 30 year old woman etc. Or even unattractive 18 year olds. 

I’m quite an insecure person and have also expressed I’m not ok with him liking other girls photos on Instagram etc. It just puts me off him. Despite all that the relationship has always been good and I’ve never had reason to suspect him of cheating. However, his friend once sent me snapchat of him joking tickling and grabbing a female friends boobs and ever since that the trust hasn’t been 100%. 

I would never go out and ask random men to follow me on any social media whilst drunk as I would think that would be a disrespectful thing to do whilst in a relationship. There is also no other reason I would want a random boy to follow me unless I found him extremely attractive. 

I do really love him but I find his behaviour really suspicious and I don’t have the energy to be with a man who isn’t trustworthy. 

Any advice would be great.

584,e6fs4x,his-names_RemusLupin,1575544366.0,1,I (24F) don't know how to react to my (24F) friend ditching my graduation party,"Important context before the actual problem: I am going to graduate next Thursday from my Master of Sciences and while I'll discuss my thesis that day, my actual party will be on Saturday. 

Amy is a long-time friend of mine, basically the only contact I've kept from high school and we know each other really well. She has always had some troubles with her health (nothing major, but a lot of small issues that I know are super uncomfortable to live with); she's also visiting a psychologist on a weekly basis to deal with her messy emotional status. On top of that, her mother is going through some more important health problems, again nothing extremely serious but enough to make you worry about it. While I admire her perseverance in every single one of these aspects and have always provided support, I have also known her long enough to be able to say that sometimes she just likes to whine (again, totally understandable, I don't judge her for it, just wanna paint a clear picture of her).

She told me today that she will be there on Thursday, but will actually just pass by on Saturday because her boyfriend's best friend is probably (no plans made yet) gonna have a birthday party that day. Now, I'm not actually one that's super emotional about this stuff, if she had any kind of serious issue I'd totally understand. Damn, she could just have told me ""I don't want to stay out too long because I'm tired"" and I would have totally understood. But she's been with this guy for a little more than one year and his friends are complaining that they spent too much time together. I didn't really notice because we don't live near each other and actually hang out once every month or so, but I feel like episodes like this one are what his friends usually complain about. 

On one hand, I'm worried about the health of the relationship she's living; on the other, I'm also a little hurt by her having to go with him and not even considering remaining at my party by herself, since she also knows most of the people that are gonna be there. 

Should I tell her? Or should I just let it go and just pretend it is not a problem? I am not good at confrontation and she is even worse than me, there's a real possibility we'd end fight about it, considering I am stressed about my discussion and she has her own troubles at home and with herself that I don't want to increase without a real cause. 

TL;DR: long-time friend won't be staying at my graduation party to go to boyfriend's best friend birthday; this both worries me and hurts me, but I don't want to fight with her for something minor, since we're both stressed out and won't probably solve the problem by discussing it.",relationship_advice
585,e6fs4c,ThrowRAguy1993,1575544362.0,18793,FINAL UPDATE : I (26M) found out my fiance (27F) possibly gave a stripper a handjob at her bachelorette party,"\*\*3rd and most likely last update. Original update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e35vj6/i\_26m\_found\_out\_my\_fiance\_27f\_possibly\_gave\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e35vj6/i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f_possibly_gave_a/)

I deleted the original post, but put a recap in the original update.

It's been 10 days since I received the call that ended this relationship. I'm almost back to normal, although I can't quite shake a bit of malaise. Thankfully I had a few days worth of PTO to burn while I worked past this crap. I already scheduled my 2 weeks vacation this year for the wedding, but since it's canceled I'll just spend it with the family and have a very extended Christmas with them.

Outside of a few texts from Jane to my mother when things first blew up and her mother calling the next day after I talked to Janes stepfather, I haven't heard a peep from their clan since. Janes mom tried to act as a mediator between us, but I shut that shit down and told her it's not possible. She can be a bit pushy, but thankfully she realized it wasn't wise to push this time. I finally got to talk to the bridesmaid who's husband called me. She didn't offer any more details and I didn't care to ask for any more by the time I talked to her. She just called me when she felt comfortable enough to wish me well and tell me she was sorry for what happened. She's a very nice lady and I feel bad for her because she works with quite a few of those women, and I don't envy how they are going to treat her at work. I asked her and thankfully none of them have any managerial authority over her, but it still sucks to ostracized.

As far as any of the other women, I haven't heard a thing, and my cousin has done a vanishing act. My mom took care of cancelling all the wedding invitations as she was the one who helped send them all out. I asked her to just tell everyone that Jane and I had a change of heart about getting married and decided to put things off for the time being. Frankly I'm fucking embarrassed about what happened and don't really want to be known among family and friends and people in town as that guy who's ex-fiance jacked off and possibly screwed a stripper right before their wedding. I'm sure it will eventually get around, but if I let it fade like this it will be more of a crazy rumor than confirmed fact for most people.  I really just want to walk away with as little drama as possible and move on with  my life.

I've asked my mother to text Janes mom to get the engagement ring back. Hopefully she won't give me any trouble as they were expensive and buddy of mine is willing to buy the ring set for exactly what I paid for them for his wedding in a few months. I told him he'd better not tell his girlfriend where he got them just in case she's worried my ex was wearing the ring when she was handling stripper guys joystick. I lost thousands in deposits for the venue, DJ, florist, catering, security, plane tickets, honeymoon suite, etc etc etc... I'm hoping I can recoup a little money by selling the rings.

Anyway, I've decided to stay away from LTR's for an indefinite amount of time. This experience has made me very gun shy about ""love"" and relationships and all that mess. People have sent me all kinds of of encouraging messages claiming I'll eventually find ""the one"". I'm doing my best not to be overly pessimistic, but when looking at the divorce rates and all the crazy conflicts between men and women these days, I'm starting to think the chances for *anyone* to do that are getting lower with each passing year. And I'm not the kind of guy who gets over stuff like this by running out and dating some other woman to sport hump right afterwards.

So I think I'll just stay single for now, and focus on my passions and work. Anyway, thanks to everyone who gave encouragement. If anyone else goes through something heartbreaking like this, I highly recommend you you stay with family and or close friends you have a good relationship with. I can't overstate how much this helped, especially if you are a guy. Men don't really maintain a circle of support for stuff like this, like many women do, and you can find yourself isolated and descending further into a bad place without positive reinforcement around you. I was able to lay on my childhood bed, in my childhood room, in my childhood home surrounded by good memories, having my mom come in and bring me tea and food and say sweet encouraging things about how much she loved me and how proud she was of me. I was able to shit talk with my dad and brothers to distract myself. It helped a lot.

Best of luck everyone. Thanks.",relationship_advice
586,e6fop1,egbr98,1575543757.0,1,How do I live with it?,"  I've met this girl at college and we immediately hit it off. We've known each other for a month and no one knows me right now better than her, and she says the only person who knows her as well as me is a friend she's known for seven years. She could tell I have a thing for her, but she acted like she couldn't, and I kept on trying to reach out. Eventually, she told me about how she's into this other guy who studies with us, at which point I told her about my feelings. She's been the best of friends and we ended things amicably. The problem is, she suffers from depression and her emotions are somewhat fragile. And I'm the only one she can count on. The other guy is so insensitive he can't even bother to ask if she's okay (even when her chin is glued to her chest) and she doesn't trust him with her problems. She also mentions how she's starting to get a little frustrated with him and how he's very closed about things with her as well. Which kills me, because she deserves much better. So that's where I find myself. I'm the only one who can brighten her day, I'm the only one who can try and convince her to eat when her anorexic habits return, I'm the only one she trusts to talk about how shitty her home has been and I'm the only one who she can truly be herself with. She's emotionally unavailable to see me in a different way because of that other dude, but I've never felt this intimate to anyone else. I love her, and I've told her as much, and even though it would be better for me to take a step back, I worry about her a lot, and when we spend the day together it's just magical. One thing is for sure, I'm stuck with her for life. I'm not walking out on her and she says she absolutely hated to see me getting distant because of my feelings for her. Now, how do I live with it? How do I ignore the never ending hint that we'll end up together? How do I deal with my own depression and go through this drama which could not have come at a worst time? How do I care for her without forgetting to care for me?",relationship_advice
587,e6fnyl,thatlundgirl,1575543633.0,5,Girl I've been seeing wants to try polygamy. I don't.,"Hey.

So I've been seeing this girl for a few months at university now. Things seemed a bit distant at first but have gotten good lately and I love spending time with her. She's everything I want.

But a couple dates ago she asked what I think of polyamory and admitted she had seen someone else whilst seeing me (which is fine, as we weren't and aren't exclusive). I've had a lot of history with cheating and being used and I'm not polyamorous. She said she wants to ""try"" it, but 1) it sounds more like she wants an open relationship, and 2) I can't help but think it's more of a commitment problem than actual polyamory.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to end it, but I don't want to continue if that's what she wants. I'm scared that if I talk to her about it, it will have to end and that'll be that.

Any advice?",relationship_advice

Im a 19 year old guy, boyfriend is 20. Ill be referring to him as Jack, and to the girl he kissed as Bailey. Jack and I live in America and we've been dating for almost two years. 
For context, Bailey is someone we both know.  Shes the person through which we met eachother. I dated her in freshman year of high school and after her and I broke up, Jack and Bailey got to be really close. They never dated because Bailey's mom didnt like Jack. Before Jack and I got together they only kissed a few times, and then Bailey's mom told her she wasnt allowed to be Jack's friend anymore, which resulted in Bailey completely cutting Jack out of her life with no explanation.
 If this seems extreme, it was. Bailey's mom was highly abusive and controlling. It wasn't Bailey's decision.
Losing Bailey was very significant for Jack because they had a strong connection and Jack had been in and out of a few shitty relationships leading up to Bailey, and because the way they stopped talking was so abrupt and unexpected, it really hurt.
 It was basically the straw that broke the camel's back. Jack got very depressed, suicidal, and started using drugs heavily. After a while he stopped using, went to therapy and returned to a place of relative happiness, although he still deals with depression. 
A couple years went by and this is when Jack and I started talking and eventually got together. 
About a week ago, Jack messaged Bailey to apologize, because the last time they had talked, he was very high and had said some hurtful things. 
They started talking, and a couple days later she dropped by his work to say hi, and he kissed her. 
So that pretty much sums up the situation. 
He immediately regretted it, but didnt want to tell me over text so he waited until he could tell me in person. I think he was fully expecting me to break up with him. He didnt eat for two whole days before seeing me because he felt so bad about what had happened. I don't doubt that he was telling the truth about how bad he felt, he's always been honest with me, and he couldnt fake the way he seemed when he told me. He said he thinks that it's the worst thing he's ever done. 
I think what bothers me the most is that I didn't even know how big of a person Bailey was for him. He didn't share any of that with me until this. He also didn't tell me he was talking to her, or that she was going to visit him at work. I was completely in the dark about everything. 
He stayed at my place and we talked, pretty much for three days straight. He blocked her on everything. We talked about why this happened, and what needs to change. I told him he needs to be more open and forthcoming about his past and whats going on in his life. He agreed. He said he wasnt thinking when he kissed her. He was too overwhelmed about seeing her again.
The important part is, he doesnt want to be with her. I absolutely do not think that he would be trying this hard to fix things and feeling this much regret if he didnt want to be with me. 
But how do I forgive him? How do I trust him again? He really hurt me. He's never hurt me before, ever. 
I was cheated on in a previous relationship, but I didn't stay around that time. That relationship was too broken in too many ways to be fixed. 
I don't know how to move on. I just want to be able to trust him the way I did before. I don't want to be angry at him. It just feels so shitty.

My fiancè and I have been together for 5 1/2 years. We recently moved into our first house together (bought, not rented), but lived together for 3 years beforehand (with and without flat mates).

He's such an incredible partner - he's kind, he's loving, he's smart, etc. He has his flaws - such as sometimes I think he's a bit too laid back, and a bit of a people-pleaser (struggles to say no - but not as bad now as he was). But I have MANY flaws as well, lol.

His background is NOT pretty. He came from a pretty rough area (we live in the UK, by the way), his dad left his mom when he was 7, they had to sometimes choose between eating something small and staying warm, his older brother used to grow weed in the house (SUPER fucking illegal), you know the drill.

His mother is, I like to put it, a bit of a ""free spirit"". Not saying that my fiancè for his brother shouldn't have existed, but she should NOT have had kids. She likes to make a tiny bit of cash (like, just enough), and live her life how SHE wants.

She has NEVER put any effort in to improve her living situation. Never took any courses (you can get free ones over here), and DEFINITELY never aspired to be anything useful. She's super lazy, and has lost a fucktonne of jobs in the past due to this.

Now don't get me wrong, I do feel some sympathy for the woman. She has been in multiple physically abusive relationships since my fiancès dad left - the most recent of which meant that she had to sell her (crappy) house and move.

But before then and since, she has done NOTHING to help herself. Apart from this: she begs family for money.

Keep in mind, she smokes quite a bit.

First her dad, then her mom, then my fiancès brother, and then my fiancè. Every time she runs out of cash, she begs.

She's been asking my fiancè (let's call him C) for money for at least 2 years that I know of. He did a placement year at Uni that paid (not much money, but paid), and during that he was sending her hundreds. We were living together at the time, so when I found out I lost my fucking shit at him. I understood that he wamted to help, but he ended up running out of money himself, and I had to remind him of her smoking habit. He has since cut down what he sends her, and makes most of it a loan (she does pay him back to be fair) 

She didn't relent for a long time, until thing's came to a head on C's birthday. Keep in mind, she NEVER calls unless she wants money. She didn't call on his birthday, but the day after, she rang. I thought ""yay, she's wishing him a happy birthday!"". But when he hung up and came back to sit next to me, he looked reeaaal fuckin sad. I asked what she said, and SHE ASKED FOR HIS FUCKING BIRTHDAY MONEY. KEEP IN MIND, IN ALL THE YEARS I HAVE KNOWN C, SHE HAS NEVER BOUGHT HIM A BIRTHDAY PRESENT. HIS OWN GODDAMN MOTHER, ASKED FOR HIS BIRTHDAY MONEY!!!!!

I lost my fucking shit, but this time focusing it at her and not C. Like, who fucking does that?

I called my mom in tears, because I didn't know what to do. My heart was broken. She then decided to take matters into her own hands - something I didn't give permission to do (my mom doesn't do boundaries - we're working on that). She spoke to C's mother about the fact that we're STUDENTS (at the time), and don't have money to throw around.

She stopped asking for a while, until that June when we finished Uni, and C and I started working full-time.

I saved my ass off at Uni, and was able to put a 15% deposit of a gorgeous 2-bedroom house. It's my proudest achievement (C did put some money down as well, but he's paying me back his half monthly).

Keep in mind that we had JUST moved. This bitch starts calling him again (he hadn't heard from her at all since my mother spoke to her), asking for money. C sends it her, but as a loan. I start getting pissed off again, because JUST FUCKING SORT YOUR LIFE OUT WOMAN!

She has asked about 5 times in the last 3 months, for between £10 and £25 a time. It's driving me fucking insane, and I have told C this. I have said that his family all need to have an intervention with her - that they will NOT be giving her anymore money, and that she needs to sort her shit out. I tell C that is WILL NOT WORKunless everyone is committed to it.

C agrees at first, but I KNOW that he won't do it. He always has this look when he says he's gonna follow my advice but doesn't.

I want to talk to C's mother about how fucking ridiculous this is, but he has forbidden me from doing so - saying that it's ""his mom"" and that it's ""his problem"", but it upsets me so fucking much.

Reddit, what can I do? It breaks me apart everytime he speaks to her - because every damn time it's to beg. It hurts me so much to watch. Do I speak to her against C's wishes? Do I just leave it? HELP!

TL;DR - Fiancès (C) mother won't stop begging for cash. She's done it for years. It's pissing me off majorly now. What do?",relationship_advice

I feel like im ready for the next stage in our relationship even tho we are both young and i feel like he isnt ready. He doesnt wanna leave his parents house and he doesnt want me to live with him and his parents. He had an ex live with him and it didnt work out so well, but thats part of the issue i think.

I feel like he had already lived with his ex for over a year and hes been at that stage with someone, and even tho im ready for that, he isnt ready for some reason. It seems like he was willing to take his relationship to the next level with his ex, but with me he is hesitant.

594,e6fkzu,lunaraveness,1575543081.0,6,My fiancé (M24) tells me he doesn't think he loves me (F24) as he should,"So this is a long one I guess -
Me and my fiancé got engaged two months ago, after being together for three years. Things were great for a week... But all of a sudden, things felt different. I recognised this from before, when my fiancé gets depressed he acts differently (hard to explain.) Anyway, he's a man who likes his space to gather his thoughts before coming to me with them. So, I took a backseat approach while keeping an eye. Things were up and down, our sex life started to plummet. 

We both agreed on a date for the wedding early on in our engagement, something he wanted. As the date we wanted was two years away, I took straight to planning. 

This brings us to yesterday. I've been wanting to say something but as mentioned, needed to give him some space. But yesterday, I cracked I guess. 

I asked him ""is everything okay?"" And he broke down crying. He told me that he can't seem to enjoy anything: his hobbies, our relationship, wedding planning etc. We've been through this a few times in our relationship (and I've dealt with my fair share of MH issues), so I tried to put my feelings aside but some of the things he said were hard to hear. He said he felt like he doesn't love me as much as he should, it isn't fair to string me along, he feels a lot of pressure for the wedding (my dad has offered to pay for the wedding) and generally feeling meh about it all. I tried to be there for him as much as I could.

He's told me in the past that he doesn't like having a fuss made over him, so as hard as it was to do - I suggested that we played a video game we're enjoying at the moment, we ended up having a laugh. We even had sex! It felt so much like before. 

Today, he's back at work so I'm reflecting.

I feel conflicted and somewhat annoyed (I know, I shouldn't be really.) In some ways, I feel annoyed because I don't get why he proposed if he wasn't ready? Why he wanted to have a date (which the venue is provisionally booked and same with registrar)? Does he just not love me anymore? Is this depression talking? Is he just scared?

We really get along well, work in the same field and compliment each other's personalities.

I've always been a fairly independent person. Self motivated. Good parents. No trauma or baggage. Past relationships have been pretty run of the mill. 

She married very young (18) into a abusive christian relationship and got a divorce last year. (9 years married)

At first, she expressed that she needs to feel like she is heard and validated, to which I agreed and continue to try my best to do so. I feel it's gotten to a point that I'm unable to share an opinion or say anything anywhere near when shes talking without being told that I'm insensitive and constricting her. I find most of our ""conversation"" are not conversations... but tests to see how little I listened. My brain works as a problem solver and I have issues just shutting up and listening without adding some sort of feedback or opinion or suggestion.

Recently, she brought up that I'm showing signs of contempt. She says shes very well versed in relationships, emotions and goes to therapy frequently. She gave me a print out of the way I should be speaking to her. I felt the examples listed were much more extreme cases but I agreed to try harder. I did a bit of research on where this print out came from and came across gottman.

I have a theory as to what is happening but I'm not sure if I'm just an asshole now. Honestly, I have never felt so emotionally exhausted. I've never had to consciously think how ever single word I say can cause such a negative reaction. I feel that I'm walking on eggshells. I believe this is because she is so well versed in relationship therapy and is trying to shape me too quickly into something that fits her needs but also something that I have never experienced and i have a hard time processing it.

&#x200B;

I am a 29 year old male living in western Europe in a capital city. I have a steady job, nice family, lots of friends. Actually I am pretty happy but something has been gnawing on me for some time. 

I met my GF (30) 7 years ago, we fell in love and have been together ever since. She is a beautiful woman whith whom I can laugh and have fun, she also has an insecure and jealousy side. In the beginning of our relationship this side was way more on the surface which brought some trouble with it. She was always scared I was going to cheat on her / leave her, this due to being traumatized by her ex. I was always patient with this behaviour and put up with a lot of her shit. In the first three years I never had the feeling she trusted me for 100%. After a lot of talking and therapy this got way better. We were happy for a while. 

Then she cheated on me with a colleague after 5 years in the relationship, this was going on behind my back for half a year. I was angry and threw her out of my appartment, we had a break for three weeks. She kept on convincing me that it was a mistake and that she wanted me back. I believe her and we came back together. I truly feel that she wants ME now, and no one else. We went on for two years and I kind of dealt with the fact that she cheated. 

&#x200B;

To the present day: 

She wants  to settle down and get kids, this makes me feel really nervous. She has been wanting this for two years now and I have always been postponing it, saying I'm not ready and too young. We are now in the phase that we will start having sex to get pregnant starting february, she is craving really hard to have a baby. Now that I have a date set it makes me really shit my pants. I do not feel ready to have kids.  I really love her and our lives are intertwined like hell, but somehow it feels like I will be trapped when I get kids with her. There is no way out anymore if i start this process. I have not told her in any way that I do not want kids with her because of her, I always said i was 'not ready'. I feel like I'm starting to get to know myself more and more and the answer is that I do not want to have them with her.

The fact that I cheated for the first time in my life last weekend complicates matters. I was in another town with my friends (no GF's). Met this wonderful Spanish girl in a bar, we kissed, I got her number and left the bar in a hurry because I did not want my friends to find out to cover up the evidence. Kissing this girl did something to me: I have always been in a relationship and never really chased down girls. This felt so good and it boosted my confidence. I'm feeling more ready than ever to download Tinder and get on with dating, meeting new girls, exploring people of the other sex. All of this because of the Spanish girl, she stands as a symbol for the life I have never had.

&#x200B;

I would like advice on the following: If I read all of the above, it seems pretty clear to me: I need to break up with my GF because she is not the woman I want to share the rest of my live with. I want to date other girls and be free for a while now I still can. However, somehow my mind just blocks when I think about breaking up with her. I just cannot imagine all the misery that will come of it. She will be without an appartment, her deeply embedded desire to have a child will be shattered. I just CANNOT do it! Whenever I think of breaking up, a little voice in my head says 'nah, not gonna happen'. When I think of having a kid though, I get panicked and do not want that either. I have put myself in a really shitty position and now that all my postponing won't work anymore, I will have to go through pain; but I do not now how to handle this and am not ready to go through this misery. This predicament makes me really unhappy and stressed out. 

&#x200B;

Please do you guys / girls have any advice? What would you do if you were me?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

598,e6fiq2,Bonniebun32,1575542639.0,2,21(F) is wondering if her 24(m)partner’s usage of porn is okay.,"I(the 21F) is wondering if it’s really okay or normal for a guy to watch porn in order to get in the mood.

I just recently got around to getting more comfortable with sex and enjoying it more since I suffer from PTSD and psychotic mdd relating to sexual abuse in my childhood.

This guy (who is schizophrenic) is my first time but I feel so bad that he has to look at porn to even be in the mood.
I feel like me just being me isn’t good enough anymore and it took a lot for me to just
Enjoy sex like the pornstars do etc. and do things like how they do it to get him off. Around that time, all I wanted to do was talk to him and hang out, not please him since it was kinda scary. 
But I’ve tailored myself to please him and find a way to instead of feel awful whenever I can’t.

But now it’s been more of a dry spell and I specifically changed  how I look at sex etc. JUST for that.

Instead, he’d prefer to talk and do what I wanted to do in the first place so I feel enraged and really frustrated. He takes meds and so do I but, he says it’s exhausting to please me and avoids doing it more now. So it’s me doing more pleasing than getting a mutual release and I’m feeling really destroyed and depressed about it.

I do everything that I can to please him. But I feel angry and I blame myself for not being able to climax within a certain limit of time because of really bad stress and probably meds.
I felt bad for being me in the first place for even having a mental illness because of the many times he got upset with me for not being okay. We talked about it and it lessened but Jesus.


He’s been watching porn since at a young age, which is even more concerning and it makes me feel sick to my stomach.

He says that whenever I’m away, he’s free to look at it and jack off but it makes me feel like I’m the worst to know that we differ in this aspect and that I don’t understand nor relate.

Just looking at him, his voice, and his touch and kisses gets me in the mood and I told him that I feel as if I’m weird or alienated or bad for that.
I also don’t like porn...
I looked at it one day and it gave me an existential crisis.

I’m currently in a stressful place at home so I visit him because I love him and want to escape from a situation that I can’t even fix and that only effects me because I have to live there.
So I cry and feel depressed a lot. And stay over there at his house one month max.
But whenever I’m okay,
And I ask whenever I’d like to have sex,
It’s been no and the only time he does it is whenever I come back from staying away a week or so.
 So twice or thrice in a month.

Reddit, is it bad that he does this majority of the time to get in the mood now and days?
Is there something wrong with me?

I've been with my BF (James) for 5 years and everything was going well, my family have accepted him which is nice because he hasn't spoken to his in 8 years. We've spoken about getting married and having kids together and he proposed a few months back in June. I found out I was pregnant at the end of September. He was coming home one night after being out with friends when he got into an accident. It was really really bad, they had to amputate both legs just below the knees.

He was hospitalised for a couple of weeks and is in both physical and mental therapy. He's been quiet since he's been back, hardly ever speaks and rarely eats, which I understand as it's been too much for me to handle and I'm not the one directly affected. I thought we needed a bit of good news so I told him about the pregnancy, he didn't react much but said he's 'happy for me'. That night I could tell something was bothering him so I asked what it was, that's when he told me he wants to break up. I was really upset so I asked him why, he said that he didn't want to marry me as I'd have to essentially be his caregiver for 50+ years. That I 'deserve a husband and the child deserves a father, not half of one, how can I take care of a child when i can't take care of myself.' I told him I love him and always will but he wouldn't accept any of it.

I moved out the next day and now it's been  2 months and he has me and my family blocked on everything. My family and friends reached out to him but he didn't answer, I reached out to his friends but their only saying he's ok and not to worry, but I can't stop worrying.

I (M, 18) am in a relationship with a girl for some months now. When I first met her, I thought *I want to get together with that girl*. I texted her, and couldn’t believe how lucky I was when she was actually interested in me. Eventually, we started dating.
This is my second „serious“ relationship in that we are really happy, spend as much time together as we can, have sex whenever we see each other, talk about everything, and so on.
She is *really, really* in love with me, and even said she could imagine marrying me - which I find crazy, since she’s still in school, and I just started going to university, which is also the reason we only see each other on the weekends.
But lately, I am starting to feel different. At first, I really wanted her, and even thought I’d fell in love with her (which wasn’t the case in my first relationship). Now, however, I don’t anticipate the weekends as much anymore, get annoyed when she texts me while I’m working or playing with friends, and notice so many small things about her that I dislike. I even started thinking about breaking up with her.
It was the same way during my first relationship. I didn’t love the girl - she was the one who initiated the relationship - but I was happy for some time, until I got bored and ended it.
However:
- She is - like I said - really happy with me. Before we got to know each other, she was very depressed, and she keeps telling me how great I am and how much I helped her.
- She is one of the best friends of the girlfriend of one of my best friends, which is also how we met. Because of that, she is also part of my friend group. That means I wouldn’t just never see her again if we broke up, and I don’t know what my friends and the girlfriend of my best friend would think of me.
- I don’t know what she would do if I left her. She could start hurting herself again or - I don’t want to think about it - even try to kill herself.

They have a ridiculous amount of messages in the past week. The conversation reminded me of conversations I used to have with her when we first started going out. 

I asked her did she not consider how this would make me feel and she told me she didn’t even realise how it could be seen that way but she can see now. There was no flirtatious texts really - just a lot of ‘learning’ about one another.

I’ve had quite a few things/sexual partners (both female and male) and some are still friends because they started as friendships and were just some fun. I’ve been completely honest with her from the beginning about this. As far as I know I’m the first person she has been with besides kissing other people. 

Recently a really close friend that I had a thing with in the past had moved back to Australia (let’s call her Ruby). This thing was purely emotional as she was overseas, never did we kiss or even hug while we were seeing each other, it was all long distance and we decided to end it as we valued our friendship and it just wasn’t realistic. We decided to catch up since I hadn’t seen her in over 3 years and my girlfriend was fine with this. When I caught up with Ruby I found out she just broke up with her long term bf due to the distance.

A few days later my friends hosted a friends-giving dinner and Ruby was attending and I brought along my girlfriend and she told me she was comfortable  and happy to meet her. We stayed for a few hours and I could tell my gf was getting tired or upset so we left. 

Later that night she started to ask a few questions about her and saying things like “I’m surprised you were ever interested in someone like that”. Throughout the week, every night she brought her up asking questions like: “If you weren’t with me, would you be with her?” “When you hung out with her the other week, did you ever talk about when you use to like each other?” “Do you talk to her often?” “Now that she is single, does she want to be with you?”

The questions seemed to pop up out of no where and always right before bed. She has pretty much said that she doesn’t want me to spend time with her, which hurts a bit as she was a very close friend first. She has started having dreams of me cheating on her. I’m starting to feel like I’ve done something wrong and I haven’t. I would never cheat on my girlfriend as it’s happened to me before and to a lot of close people to me and I’ve seen how it destroys relationships and families. I’ve explained this to her and that my relationship with Ruby is just as friends and that I would never put myself in a situation where something could happen. 

When I think about this, I’ve noticed she gets upset when I want to hang out with friends for dinner or even brekky on a weekend. She says that I don’t spend enough time with her. We do live together and I see her every night of the week. She even gets upset when I hang out with my sister and I’m home late. 

She is quite introverted and I’m pretty extroverted and I LOVE spending time with family and friends. Numerous times I’ve invited her to meet friends and  to come out with us and she always makes an excuse and then I usually cancel. 

This is really starting to play on my mind and bug me. I’m not sure how to bring it up with her anymore. In the past when I have she just says I don’t understand her and I’m not doing enough to see things from her point of view. It often turns into an argument and I’m the one to apologise for whatever. It’s getting to the point where I don’t know if I even want to be with her anymore. I still love her but it’s a massive turn off.

I feel like I need to ask permission to see family or my friends and she will say well it’s not up to me and so I do go out and spend time with them and then when I’m back home she acts like I’ve done something wrong or she will be real short with me. She always ask that I’m constantly in contact with her and keeping her in the loop ( I do understand being kept in the loop about what time I’ll be home etc...) but if I don’t reply fast enough, I get told off when I’m home. 

I’ve just not even bothered asking to hang out with mates to avoid all this trouble and feeling like I’m doing something wrong.

How should I feel?","My boyfriend (20M) of one year has suddenly told me that in the future he would want to have sex with other girls. I can’t wake up thinking of this everyday, thinking whether I’m going to be cheated on or not. He says it’s not cheating because he would tell me when he will have sex with them and that there will be no feelings involved. Furthermore he says that it’s human instinct and all men in relationships are like this and would want to have sex with other girls. 

Is this true? 

BTW we had a great great relationship over the past few months we never argued we were always happy, or was that just me? Was i blindsided to this? Is he happy with me or not? I honestly believed that we would get married in the next few years. 

I just want to put out there that he has never hurt me before . He has always put me first and has always made me so happy, He really is an amazing friend. Even though I am broken to the core I can still really put my hand down and say he is one of the most nicest, amazing man I have met. 

I immediately broke up with him but I love him so much I love him more than anything anyone could ever imagine. He keeps telling me that he loves me too but I don’t know if I can believe it. I believed that he was my soulmate and now I feel soulless. I have woken up and all I feel is a deep sinking sensation in my heart. I want to cry and let my emotions out but I can’t. I want to still be his friend I want to be in his life until he is over this phase. Is this even a phase? Are all men like this? Did I overreact? Please give me some advice. Advice on anything.

609,e6f6h3,tooyoung4bump,1575540268.0,2,How do I tell my parents I’m pregnant at 21? Living abroad for college & terrified of a bad reaction.,"I am currently 8 weeks pregnant. I found out for sure around two days after my missed period, but I had some suspicions earlier than that. I’m 21 years old and living in Japan for university (we are from the US, though my parents don’t live there.) The father (my boyfriend) of the baby is from a country close to Russia. It’s all a bit complicated in terms of geography and family dynamics so telling parents in person is out of question. 

I was on birth control when I got pregnant, so it’s unplanned but ultimately we decided to
keep. I wanted to wait until I had my first OB appointment before I told my parents and I had it yesterday. Now my heart is literally leaping out of my chest at the idea of telling them. They are divorced and live in different countries for work. I don’t have a positive relationship with my mother at all. Whereas I have an extremely close relationship with my dad. 

Ultimately I know my dad is going to be supportive of my decision and of me in my choices, even if he’s taken back at first. It doesn’t stop me from being absolutely terrified to tell him. 

I graduate in June, the baby is due in July. It’s almost perfect timing but I am still a college student who is relying heavily on parental support. I currently work two part time jobs and have made quite a bit to build up a nice savings, it’s not enough to mark myself financially independent. I can’t exactly leave Japan and go to the US where it may be cheaper for me because of where the father is from. 

I know that sounds like very unnecessary information. I need advice on how to tell my mom and dad that I’m pregnant. My mom is Indian and American, but the Indian side of our family is strict. I can’t imagine their reaction especially when they find out the father is Muslim (I don’t have a problem with this, but elder family will.) On the other hand, Im terrified of disappointing my dad. I don’t want him to feel let down. 

I had a bright future ahead. I still have a very bright future ahead and having a baby doesn’t impact my career goals, luckily. I just don’t want him to feel ashamed. 

What’s the best way for me to tell my parents? How can I get over my fear of telling them? I need advice, my heart feels like it will explode. 

I feel like I should be ashamed of this pregnancy because it’s unplanned but I am so excited.

Edit: when I found out I was pregnant, I sat down and made several plans and back up plans for personal finances, career options, etc. So I do plan to tell my dad all my plans as well.",relationship_advice

So I just need some advice, I(15F) am in a relationship with a guy(16M) my around age and honestly, it is stressing me out. We are both in high school and are normal teenagers (in my opinion). A little about me is that I think I have a sleeping disorder because I am constantly tired and sleep a lot, also I  have anxiety and go to a doctor/therapist for it. For my significant other he says he has anxiety and depression and in my opinion should get help for it but his family does not have to money for it. So my issue is that he gets really clingy to the point where he says he gets either irritated with me because I am not talking to him and giving him 100% attention for more than an hour or says he hates himself because I am not talking to him. I want to talk to him and stuff but I do extracurriculars (soccer and choir) that make me busy and I try to be a good student and try to do my homework. I am busy after school most of the time or spend time catching z's because like I said constantly tired. I really do feel bad when he texts me and I can't reply but idk what I should do about this because I still want to be in a relationship but I sometimes question it and just want my alone time.

612,e6f4c2,ThrowRAnaes,1575539895.0,2,Girlfriend broke up with me unexpectedly. We want to stay friends but I don't know how to handle the situation.,"I'll start with some back story. I (21M) and my ex (20F) started dating at the beginning of September. We both only had one prior relationship but considered this to be our first real one. I'm in the military and she is in college. We are located in the same state but are to far away for us to see each other regularly. We knew going into the relationship that it was going to be long distance but we both accepted that. We went on a few dates in person at the start but I had to leave the state temporarily for work and she had to go away to uni shortly after we started dating. This seemed fine because we already spent most of our time talking on discord anyways and it was up until recently.

Flash forward to the last few weeks. I'm back in the same state as her and she is approaching finals so she is super busy and stressed with studying and homework (understandably), but everything is going great. We used to talk on discord or on the phone pretty much every day, but we weren't able to as much because she is too busy. We would still text everyday at least and things seem fine. Then Thanksgiving comes around. She goes to celebrate the holiday with a friend's family that lives near her and I go to visit my family. We text a bit here and there but I notice that her responses get shorter and seem almost disinterested. Three days later on Sunday we finally get a chance to talk on the phone and she suddenly says that she wants to break up. She said that she couldn't handle school and being in a relationship at the same time and that she was kinda resetting on our relationship. For context: When she doesn't have regular contact  with someone she kind starts forget the level of relationship she built up with them (she told me about this at the start of the relationship). She made it clear that it was a problem on her part and not a problem with me. Needless to say it was a shock for me and I didn't really know what to do. I kinda just said ""I understand"" and let it happen. That obviously wasn't how I felt but I hadn't really processed it yet and thinking on it now I'm not really sure I had a choice anyways. The relationship didn't end in a fight so we ended on good terms and she expressed interest in remaining friends. 

The next day I called her so I could try to get out everything that I should have said the day before. I told her that she should've talked to me about it before hand instead of just dropping it on me out of nowhere. I asked her why should couldn't wait until she came back for winter break to decide (We would've been able to see each other again). She said that she didn't think it would've made a difference. I'll be honest and say that I was kind of a mess during this conversion and I didn't really say everything that I needed to or in the way that I needed to. Eventually I calmed down and we just started talking about random stuff like we used to, which made me wonder why there was even an issue. The hardest part was that she didn't seem upset about the situation at all.  I'm not trying to make her sound like the bad guy. She has been having a really rough time with uni and has been having panic attacks because of it. I understand her reasoning for breaking up and I'm not mad at her for it. Her lack of reaction to it is also just how she is. She's not the most emotional person so if she is upset about it she isn't the type to really show it. I also know that I made plenty mistakes in terms of communication too.

I guess the part that I'm struggling with is that she was my best friend. Whether she knows it or not she helped me through a lot of things and brought me out of a darker place. I don't remember ever being as happy as I was when I was with her. I know that is was only three months and it shouldn't be that big of a deal but it just hurts so much. Maybe I got to invested so this feeling is my fault. We are trying to be friends but it feels like she's not really interested or at least that it's not that high of a priority. We talked again today and played some games, but it just felt off. I also felt my heart rate skyrocket and I couldn't couldn't focus or stop moving. To top it off she had been in a private call with another guy from our friend group (who she had been talking to before we started dating) for a couple of hours (she didn't know that you could do private discord calls until we started dating, our friend group always talked on a public server). This part might just be me overthinking and being jealous, I don't want to just assume things because I'm upset and she can be friends with whoever she wants. I know that this literally only happened a few days ago so I can't expect things to be the same as they were right away, and I'm not naive enough to think that friendship is always going to work out. I just don't know how to handle the level loneliness and emptiness that I'm feeling. I feel my self slipping back into a darker place sometimes. Thank God I have some good friends that are keeping me afloat but when I'm alone I don't know what do do with myself and it starts to hurt again. 

I'm just really don't know how to handle this situation. I feel just really lost. I know that time will heal everything, but I'm not sure what to do until that point. I keep thinking of things I should've said and that maybe we could've worked it out. Maybe I should've fought it more. What should I do?

This is my first post so apologize if I rambled too much or didn't explain things very well. I probably missed a few things but this is the gist of what happened. I honesty helps to just get it all out. I'm thankful for any advice :)",relationship_advice

I have a 7 year old  and have been married once, my boyfriend has only seriously dated this girl he met online (she lives in the other side of the country). They dated for 2 years, they sent each other souvenirs, Skyped everyday, but never met physically. She cheated on my boyfriend and really hurt him. However for
A while they have been talking In a friendly way. 

What has been bothering me is that
My boyfriend has this app just to talk to her. He said she likes to use that app because it’s “kawaii” and pink and cute. However this makes me uncomfortable. They used this app a lot when they were dating, that was the only way they messaged each other. 

She also comments on his pictures on Facebook and uses cute faces in the comments.  She also likes a lot of the stuff my boyfriend likes, that I haven’t had a chance to get into, like some manga and card games. 

She’s 21, to what I know. In a different stage of life than me. My boyfriend reassures me always his feelings and does spend a lot of time with me but I can’t help to feel very insecure and angry sometimes.

616,e6f0we,Ryrymc102,1575539199.0,2,I (21F) told my friends that my gf (21F) is an alcoholic and she’s pissed at me for it.,"So my gf is an addict and has been for years. Right now she’s been drinking a lot. She drinks more than a half a fifth a night and she’s only 5’2 and weighs 118lbs. Her drinking has gotten to a point where it’s effecting our relationship in a very bad way (mentally abusing me). To the point where I’m about to leave. My life has been hell recently... and all I want to do is talk about it with someone. So, when I went out with some friends the other night they asked how me and my gf were doing. I took this opportunity to tell them about how my gf is drinking a lot and it’s making me very depressed and uncomfortable. They were very supportive and didn’t judge my gf at all because they know I love her and they are overall really good understanding people. 

Well fast forward a couple days later, my gf came up to me and told me she’s going to go detox in a hospital for a week. I was very excited to here this and was very supportive of her decision. Since she would be gone for a week I’d be alone in our apartment and I haven’t been away from my gf for more than 1 night for the past two years that we have been dating. So I took this opportunity to ask if my friends would come over to keep me company by telling them my gf is getting help. They responded by saying they were very happy to hear she was getting help too. 

So, my gf thinks everyone is out to get her... so I tried cheering her up by letting her know a lot of people care about her, including my friends. She asked me why would my friends care about her and I informed her I told them about our situation we are having and how they were happy she’s making the choice to better herself. She then proceeded to get very mad at me for telling them “her business”. 

I understand for the most part why she would feel that way because she feels probably fees embarrassed about it. But she doesn’t seem to understand that it’s effecting me a lot too and it’s nice to talk about my problems with people I trust. She would rather I lie to them and just say we are having problems and leave it at that. 

I feel as though it’s gotten to a point where it’s now my problems too especially if she’s abusing me. I did set up an appointment with a counselor to talk about these problems also so there’s that. But should she really be that mad at me for sharing what I’m going through with my friends?",relationship_advice
617,e6eylp,ThrowawayAccount6357,1575538751.0,0,Is this considered as r*pe? (NSFW),"Hi sorry i’m not sure if this is the right sub for this but I don’t really know where to put this.  And i’m also on mobile,,

Okay so My boyfriend (20M) and I (19F) have been together for almost a year now. He’s my first serious relationship and things are going pretty great. We had kind of a rocky start but besides the stuff i’n gonna write he’s been perfect for me. 

So he and his former gf had only broke up recently before we started dating. But because it was so soon he felt bad towards his ex (they are on good terms but he had fallen out of love) so we were secret about our relationship for I think a month or two. Now he has had three sexual partners before me. And I had never even kissed before him let alone have sex. I remember I wanted to take it slow and he agreed. But then totally ignored it. When we had our first kiss he already started touching my boobs. Before we even kissed he was already touching my butt. I didn’t feel too bad about that at the time because I was pretty touch starved.  

Fast forward a few weeks he started talking about getting head. He really wanted me to try. I did not feel comfortable with it so I declined and he kept asking why. So everytime I had to come up with more reasons. It’s too soon. I don’t think i’ll be good at it. I’m lightly germaphobic (which is true). I don’t feel like it. Even after I gave him ten reasons he kept asking. So one time I budged. And then it became a weekly thing. I tried to tell myself ""okay this week i’mn NOT gonna do it"" but he always managed to get me to do it. Making me feel bad or saying how good I am and stuff. I started hating hanging out because it always came down to me giving him a bj. Now he did suggest giving something in return which I did decline. I just wanted to hang out. 

So a month later we had sex for the first time which was consensual and great. I also finally confronted him about forcing me to give him a bj and he apologized. After that everything was better. Until recently.

This halloween (yes on halloween I know) i don’t really remember what happened but It ended with me crying and laying in bed. Now I have this thing were if I’ve had a panic attack or a breakdown or something alike I become mute.i have not talked with my doctor about this yet but I think it’s called ‘selective mutism’. Anyway he came to bed and started kissing me and touching me which I wasn’t confortable with so I tried to push him off. He did not notice this (i’m not that strong). And he wanted to go down on me. To which I pulled him up. He got annoyed and asked what was wrong. Considering I couldn’t talk I just shook my head. For some reason he thought I might prefer to have sex instead. So he started undressing me and at the start I tried to get his hands off me but I kind of gave up and when he struggled with my belt I helped him. I don’t know why I did that but I was more scared of making him mad then. 

So he did what he wanted to do. I remember not looking into his eyes once as an indicator that I wasn’t enjoying it. But he didn’t pick that up. So then I started crying, loudly. At first he didn’t stop but when I started hyperventilating he stopped and hugged me and ask what was going on. I couldn’t reply so I buried myself under the sheets and put my underwear back on and went to sleep. And he did too. 

The next morning I confronted him about it. I told him that I didn’t want it and was horrified he ignored my refusal. To which he said “but you didn’t say no” but I wasn’t able to. He then said “and you took your clothes off so how was I supposed to know” so I just apologized to him and never talked about it again. But it’s still haunting me. I remember looking at a poster in his room then and now everytime we have sex and I see the poster I feel dirty. He’s right that I didn’t communicate it clearly and my boyfriend has Autism so it’s very difficult for him to pick up on physical clues.

Even though everything is back to normal now and i’m still able to have normal sex, I can’t shake it off. Was he in the right? Or should I worry about this more than I do.

Also i’m sorry if this is a bit incoherent I don’t really know how to word any of this.

Update: He does know about my selective mutism and i’ve told him which kind of events trigger it.  And when I can I tell him through text, which I couldn’t in that situation.",relationship_advice

My GF and I are together for a year. She said she is happy in our relationship, could imagine her future with me and could also have children together. BUUUUUT...

A month ago, my girlfriend told me she wanted an open relationship. She can't imagine being happy in a mono relationship. She was in an open relationship before our relationship where it was all about Ones. When we came together, there was no question that we had a mono relationship.

At first it seemed as if she meant one-night-stands, but then it turned out that there was already someone she found interesting and she would like to sleep with. A friend she already knew before me and with whom she even had a drink the week before.

I wanted to talk to her about it, was open to make new experience. However, I know that I don't want my partner to have relationships, whether F+ or romantic next to me. I think it would be okay for me to allow Ones.

The problem is also that she has pretty much given me an ultimatum. I have the choice either to agree to the open relationship or for her the relationship is over. She meant that if she's still mono with me, she can't guarantee to cheat on me sooner or later.

I wanted to compromise with her to find a solution together that would make it easier for me to enter into an open relationship, but she blocked everything. We talked for a long time but she kept coming back to that point, either an open relationship as she imagines it or it's over.

I just don't know what else to do, whether I am too influenced by my feelings.

At the time she had expressed an interest in seeing my dream come true. And for a year or so it worked out well. Then things started going down hill. She became more needy, and wanted more of my attention of which I gave. As well as spending more than I should have on her lifestyle, instead of investing into my business. However 6 months ago I realized that I had put my dream off to the side for her. I ended it quickly after that, moved out on my own, and focused everything I had on my business. 6 months later I now had quit my full time and am now making three times more than I had originally. I had run into my ex here recently, so we ended up getting coffee to catch up on the short time we were apart. I told her about what I achieved. She seemed happy.

628,e6eptb,IAmAPlanty,1575537008.0,2,I (F19) keep having nightmares about my partner (M23) leaving me,"I’m not sure if I should post this here or if I’d get better informations elsewhere but here it is. (also first time posting on reddit)

I have been dating my lovely partner for about a year and a half now, everything is going perfectly. We have fantastic communication, we always talk about how things makes us feel and how we can help each other etc so much so we’ve never argued (because no resentment is ever building up). 

We share many interests but we dont have the same views on everything and that really allows us learn about different ways of thinking, and we agree to disagree.

Our sex life is perfect as well, I always feel very safe and free, and we have lots of fun.

We have a fantastic relationship, we love each other very deeply. He’s even part of my family now, my parents even said that « they could never have dreamed of a better boyfriend for me » because they’ve never seen me so happy. And it’s true.

Now about 6-8 months in the relationship, my brain has started to have nightmares in which he either leaves me, or they’re more suggestive, everything is cloudy and I’m alone, can’t seem to find him, etc. It’s been 2ish months that I have these like once a week at least. It never happens when we sleep in the same bed, always when he’s away. My partner also knows that those dreams exists I always tell him about it the very morning I wake up from them. And of course he reassures me, and I feel perfectly fine and happy as soon as I’m out of bed.

I dont panic about him leaving me when I’m conscious. 

So I want to know why the fuck my brain imagines them? Because they make me genuinely sad when I wake up until I remember my partner didnt leave me.",relationship_advice
629,e6epqi,GayNikka,1575536992.0,1,My GF has been lying to me,"Aight so long post. Basically, when I first met my gf we hooked up after a week and during the night some dude was blowing up her celly ringing her, I was like aight whatever. A while later shit is getting serious between us, she tells me about this dude (call him Joey) and that hes a strange creep she met once through mutual friends and he got extremely obsessed and kept texting her weird shit like does she want to fuck, meet up etc. I told her to text him and tell him to leave her alone and shes not interested but she says nah she just rather not text him back. Cool.

Month into us dating another guy rings her phone, I find out it's some guy she had a thing with and also wouldn't leave her alone (call him Goku) but things ended with them a few weeks before we met and Goku found a new girl, so I wasnt worried. I also find out from a close friend that my GF actually dated this dude I knew from school for about a year, she tried to hide that from me to keep it from being awkward which is fair, i wasnt  mad about it and thought that was a couple years back. She wouldn't tell me when they dated.

While this is going on Joey still blowing up her phone, she ain't texting him back. My gf and her friend go for a drink after work and her friend(Zoey) coincidentally takes my girl to a bar where Joey was a regular in. All of a sudden Joey texts Zoey asking about my girlfriend and Zoey takes care of things and tells him to leave her alone and she doesn't want anything to do with him, my girl tells me she has no idea how Joey got Zoeys number and the 2 never met before, making him seem more of a creep.

Fast forward 7 months into us being together I find out through reliable sources that, my girlfriend was a actually texting and seeing this Joey dude and fucked him few days before we met, and just out of the blue stopped texting him a week after me and her met eachother, so he wasnt that crazy after all, just heartbroken?? Also found out that her break up with her ex(dude that I kinda knew from school) was sooner than I thought, and their last messages to eachother was almost a whole month into when me and her met, and technically they were still together when her and goku started having a fling for about 2 months, but she told me she had broken up with her ex before she started seeing goku.

Fuck do I do? I hadn't said shit to her yet but all her lies she told me is making me question honesty in our relationship

We’re in a LDR of 1.8 years. We’re  freshman in college and thanksgiving break is the only time we have really seen anyone. She has an amazing group of friends from high school and some new friends in college. I am the complete opposite, as I pretty much had no one for over two years. This means she’s the only person I really have(non family), so my social life is revolved around her. She handles it really well, and over the summer we spent a lot of time together. This break though I felt like she wasn’t there enough. She got home on a Saturday and told me the first half is for her friends and the second half for me.throughout the week she said I’m all hers for the rest of the week and I realy felt like we would hang out a lot.  On Tuesday when I got back thought she said she wanted to go to a party first then I could pick her up. I chose to not go because I’m still really sad about high school and seeing everyone would be too much on the first night.  I asked that she not get drunk because my parents will wanna talk to her, and that she acts a little mean and different when drunk(will talk more about it later). I picked her up and she was pretty drunk, but was there for me when I broke down. The next day we went to lunch and decided that if I don’t find anyone to hang out with she’ll have dinner with her friends then meet me for the night. I asked some people nothing worked out, but she texted me to come pick her up at 12 right as I was heading to bed. I felt really bad as I was alone all night, and pretty much felt ignored by her. She was very drunk so we barely hung out. As I was driving her home I said how there are disparities in what she said about us hanging out. She responded with “now would be a bad time to tel you I’m going to another party then”. The next day thanksgiving and we hung out after our family dinners late at night and had a good time. She said tomorrow we should hang out as she wants to fit both me and her friends on her last day Saturday. The next day though she split me and her friends. . On Saturday we geared up for the big, but going there would make me sad as the kids who were throwing never wanted to hang with me and I realy don’t like them for what they did to me. They throw parties a lot and earlier In the year I said I wouldn’t go to one again as it makes me feel unhappy. My gf really wanted me to go as I haven’t seen anyone all break and did not want me alone while she’s with her friends. We knew it would be hard so she said she’d be sober And by my side since there is a good chance I’ll panic and that after it’ll be my night and we should make it special. I go there and have a horrible time and really talk to no one but stay positive as ima hang w her after. She gets blackout drunk tho, and after the party I’m forced to take her home. She opened up about how she’s struggling and her depression is really bad and that she drinks to feel something. I noticed she drinks a lot and often is mean to me during it and doesn’t remember it the next day. She said it’s a problem and that I need to get her help. She progressively said worse things and I ended up scared that she’ll harm herself. I got her sister and we both agreed to tell her mom. We had a convo her and her mom and we were all very understanding. She didn’t remember anything the next day but had a big talk with her mom and asked to not talk about what happened again and that she won’t drink for a while. I wanted to support her and did, but at the same time felt like I was robbed of what she said would be my night . She was really drunk for 3 of the other nights and I never got to hang out with her for more than half a night. My main problem is that I don’t feel like anyone cares for me, so it is important that I feel like she does. It made me feel really bad as I didn’t feel like a priority and I think I should tell her that it felt like she wasn’t there for me. At the same time she was really struggling and I definitely put a lot of pressure on her as if I’m not with her I’m alone. All I want is for her to hang with me more next break, but I’m scared to tell her that thanksgiving break wasn’t enough as she partly could not be there due to her drinking. I know her motives are good though and that she cares about me. What do I do?",relationship_advice

What should i say?","We have been dating for 3 months and it has become obvious to me that we are not compatible.  His room is a complete wreck and i am a minimalist. He has a very feminine personality which i am not attracted to. He has not figured out how to derive confidence from his own inner self. I find the way he acts around my friends annoying because it feels like he directs the spotlight on himself and talks to much and doesnt let other people talk. Last of all, he lasts way to long in bed, 30-60min and still wont even cum sometimes which makes me never want to have sex with him because he just rubs everything raw and it hurts for days and i have to pretend that it is at all pleasurable for me when its not at all after 15min.

I have notoriously been bad at breaking up with people, even short term relationships. Part of the problem is that he lives with his parents, and i am unsure of where to break up with him at. He is very emotional and self critical and i feel like he will take this very personally and feel very struck down by this breakup despite it being such a short relationship. Another issue i am facing is that his birthday is next week where he wants me to have dinner with his family. I obviously do not want to meet his family since i am planning on breaking up with him.  

I dont want to breakup in a public setting because i feel like he might cry and i want him to have space to do that if he so chooses but i also want to be able to leave after I say what i have to say.",relationship_advice

634,e6elvs,henlooo8,1575536246.0,1,General question: How do you know when to stop arguing with your significant other?,"Some brief background as to what prompted this question:

My (22F) BF (23M) have been together for 2.5 years, the first 2 years together at the same college. We live ~2 hours away from each other now. I love him and one of the things I love about him is how in touch with his feelings he is. However, that doesn't mean he is the best at expressing his feelings (I also struggle with this sometimes). We both actively work on this together by keeping each other accountable for our actions and words. 

When we have an argument/serious discussion/disagreement (as both fairly opinionated people often times do), it's difficult for me to let go of the negative feelings from the fight and feel the love between us. At some point in the fight we end up talking in circles and get off track of the original disagreement because we keep trying to feel like we've ""won,"" and  no real progress is made to end the fight. Even when one person or both of us say our apologies, I usually don't feel satisfied with the way we ended the conversation. How do I stop feeling this way? He'll say ""I love you"" (we do regularly say this, but in silly versions, so the real version holds a certain gravity) and move on from the fight. It's difficult and/or feels wrong to say I love you back when I have such negative feelings still, but obviously I love him anyways.

635,e6elsi,fryb4by,1575536233.0,0,My bf (26m) strangely denied me (27f) sex,"Ok so a little back story. my bf and I have been together for 4 months however we have known each other nearly 2 years. I have a high libido as long as I am treated well. We have sex nearly everyday and would have it more if we lived together. We have a crazy chemistry unlike anyone I've been with before. I LOVE having sex with him whenever and wherever I can.  I never have to initiate although I have no problem doing so. 

We haven't had sex in a week due to schedule conflicts and nothing more really. The last few days I've been really drunk or vise versa so sex hasnt happened. Normally If we stay the night with each other we start the day with a morning session.... however this morning after sobering up I initiated. I mean it's been A WEEK. He groaned and said he was ""too tired"". Not to be cocky but. ...I have never heard that from a man let alone him. This was super unlike him. So I respected it and we went back to sleep and I kinda expected after more sleep it would happen but..... It didn't. 

I did initiate again but it went ignored. Maybe I'm being vain but I have never experienced this with anyone especially him. Should I be worried? I even made a comment about how long it's been and he said ""huh, weird"" and nothing. I'm probably making much out of nothing. Any idea what could be going on?

Earlier today, while we were napping together, I went to take a picture of us on his phone. To note, I've never gone through his phone or wanted to. it's just not something I do. While I'm on his phone, I open Snapchat to take a picture. When I open it, I see an account on the recents that says ""Nudes for nudes"". The fuck? I look at the chat history and found that all he said was ""Hi"" earlier today (he never received a reply). I then attempted to confront him about it, asking him what that was. He denied that it was anything, just him saying hello to someone he added on snap. He walked off after that, but left his phone. I decided to get my evidence. (I feel awful about doing this) I took his phone, took pictures of what I saw, and found multiple premium snap accounts, one of them he even sent his phone number to. as far as I could tell, everything sexual happened before we were together. But Snapchat also deletes messages after viewing, so I don't know what else could have been there. 
I don't even know what to think about this. I've never been cheated on before so I'm not sure if this counts, or if it's just a form of porn. I don't know if I'm even going to be able to trust him after this. Am I looking into this too much? he apologized to me and claims that he talks to no one else but me. 
To make matters worse, we practically live and work together. We live in housing provided by our job. Our rooms are only a few doors apart. I have to see him multiple times, every day. And I'm not quitting this job just because of him.

637,e6el57,rojas77,1575536106.0,1,Where do me and my ex go from here?,"We broke up some 2 years ago. It was a bad break up. I maintained no contact for the first six months when she started calling me in the middle of the night. We met up once for beers and we caught up on things, nothing big. But it was cordial. We had dated for two years previous and we admitted we loved each other during the relationship. So it was surreal to talk with her again in person. I went back to her place andfell asleep with her. I woke up and left thinking we were on our way to being friends again or even getting back together. a few weeks pass by and she started dating some guy. It felt like a sucker punch. After she didn’t want to see me or talk to me. I didn’t know what to do so I didn’t do anything. I just left her alone. 6 months go by and she calls me in the middle of the night drunk trying to catch up. She starts confessing to me that she doesn’t really much care for her bf and that she would still sleep with me. Then she tells me something extremely personal, that she was raped. And I gush up, I start crying... asking her if I can see her and she refuses to see me. I persist for a couple weeks and finally goto see her. When I see her I come out hoping to give her the biggest hug and be her support. I know what she went through and it hurt me personally to know what she had gone through... (who wants that for someone they used to love?) It was strange though she seemed indifferent towards me and still though it seemed liked she didn’t care to see me. She tells me she has some of my love letters in a box and I’m thinking that this is her way of telling me she still cares. But her indifference continues and she’s adamant she doesn’t want to see me again. Nothing happens and a year goes by with no contact. (To the present) This time I initiate contact (mainly because she had popped into my mind and I missed her) but she had my number blocked. She returns my call and tells me that her phone tells her when a blocked number calls. She knew my number and so called me back. we have a conversation catching up but I felt like, at least for me, there was something we wanted to say about the past. A couple of weeks pass and I call her again at like 2 AM drunk.  she answers sounding like I had just woken her up, which is what I expected, and I go on drunkenly about how I think she still cares for me and that her answering the phone that late at night is proof. She denies it and says she was already awake. I ask her when I can see her and she just tells me she honestly  “doesn’t care to see me.” I’m surprised at this and don’t know what to say. I just make an argument that we hadn’t seen each other in years and that the past is the past. She’s not having it and refuses to meet up. We’re on the phone for a little less than two hours and it ends with me just being a drunken idiot asking her to think about it. A week goes by and I message her apologizing about the call and that I hope we could meet up as friends and that things are different but that I still love her. She doesn’t answer. So a  couple weeks go by and I call her again. No answer. But she returns my call an hour later with  a message saying she just saw my call and that she was with family. She wishes me well. And I message something similar like “I hope you’re doing well too” but she didnt write back after. And now I’m just wondering where do her and I go from here?

638,e6eki7,dickfuckassface,1575535976.0,2,My (23m) girlfriend (22f) just blocked my number and I'm extremely upset,"So I've been dating this girl for two months and we started having a lot of problems in our relationship recently.

We've been having sex less often in the past few weeks, which wasn't a big issue for me, but the other day she told me it was starting to make her feel less attracted to me. Which felt awful to hear. But sadly I felt the same way.

I haven't been a good sexual partner, I've been sort of lazy, which wasn't the case when we first started dating, because I was very eager to learn since I was a virgin. So I blame myself for not being able to satisfy her, but to me having sex less often isn't a big problem, but to her it is and the pressure hasn't been great for my performance.

Anyway moving on. Sorry for possibly sharing too much, just felt like it might have been relevant information.

She has told me since we started dating that she wanted to get married, which is totally fine, but she even told me a date for our wedding, it would be in 2021, but still, we hadn't even been together for two months yet when she said that. Recently I said that getting married wasn't an urgent matter to me and that it would probably take longer than two years for us to get married and she got very upset.

We come from very different families, mine has always been able to provide me with whatever I needed, hers hasn't. Her father was abusive and so was her step mother, which led her to cut her own body and attempt suicide multiple times. She has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and has very low self esteem. Her mother lives in another country far away, she has very few friends and pretty much no close friends. So I usually don't even consider the option of leaving her because I'm afraid of what she might do, specially since she lives alone and has told me that meeting me saved her life.

Sometimes I think I love her, but other times I'm not so sure. Maybe I'm with her because I don't believe there's anyone else that would want to be with me. But I don't think that's it. I do doubt there's anyone else that wants to be with me, but I truly care about her and want her to get better.

Today she was talking to clients for hours (1 hour and half, maybe 2), she works putting eye-lash implants, I didn't mind it too much. But then we agreed to watch something on Netflix she kept looking at her phone to talk to a client and when she wasn't looking at her phone she was looking at her cats. Maybe I overreacted, but I said I was leaving because it felt like she wasn't paying any attention to me.

When I told her that she said that situation ""reminded her of a movie in which the main character's relationship with her boyfriend 'went to shit' as soon as she started having success at her job"". Then she said she thought about breaking up with me sometimes because she thinks I should be with someone who has more free time. And blamed me for her not working during nights because she's ""making time for me"" eventhough I always try to motivate her to work and that almost every night I don't go to her house she gets mad at me.

She stopped talking to me or looking at me so I went home, and after I left her house she blocked my number. Later she replied to me when I talked to her through Intagram DMs then went to bed. I feel like shit for being blocked, like I'm a toy and she gets to lock me in a closet when she gets tired of me. I also regret starting this fight for something so small. But I  like telling people how I feel, and if I can't tell my girlfriend how I'm feeling then my relationship must be pointless.

I don't know what to do. I could apologize, but I'm not sure I did something wrong. Eventhough I'm angry I just want things to be ok between us again. Right now I want her back, but when I saw she had blocked me for a second I felt relief that I wasn't going to have to fight her. Then I got worried I lost her and now I'm upset.

639,e6ej24,NoClueWTD,1575535683.0,3,"I (22F) don't feel comfortable telling members of my family (specifically 26F, 27M) that I want to go out on dates.","Hi all,

I live in a very close-knit family, but I feel like our closeness can become toxic to me in certain situations. I am the youngest of the three, and we all live under the same roof with my parents. We all work in the family business. They share a phone. I am the only one to have gone to college, and they have never had a job outside of the family business - I'm not saying this to express superiority, just trying to tell you all more about the situation. My brother and sister have never been on a date in either of their lives, whereas I have had a few boyfriends, and I had a long-term relationship with a guy who I moved in with for 2.5 years. That relationship ended badly, and my brother and sister came to my rescue during my worst moments. I truly love them, but I feel like they control me and judge me whenever I express interest to date. 

Before leading into my current predicament, I'd like to start by giving an example of the extent of what they have done in the past. 

I went on my first date when I was 17 with a guy who was 19 that I met at my place of work. They ended up following us during the date, and they somehow peaked into his car when we were sitting in it. When on a break from college for an internship, I started seeing a guy that lived nearby, and one night, they were sitting in a parking lot across from his house when I was there. They also monitor my phone - I delete cerain apps during the day so they don't see them. I get that this is out of worry for me, but I feel like they should trust me more than they do. They treat me like a child.

I was dreading moving back home after graduating because I knew I would end up in the situation I am in now. I have zero independence and zero freedom. I have social anxiety, as do my brother and sister, so I am a very socially awkward person, but I long for friends and a relationship. When I express that I feel controlled and judged (which is mentally taxing and embarrassing for me to do), my brother and sister bring up that they were the ones there for me when no one else was. When I express that I want to move out on my own, they ask me why I want to leave them. I can't help but feel defeated and guilty everytime this happens. I love them, but I want a life of my own. 

As for my current situation: I have been playing around on Tinder, and I started out of loneliness, but I matched with a guy that I genuinely like, and he asked me to meet him for coffee. He said he would pick me up and go somewhere near my house. I am almost never alone, unless I am in the shower or running late at night, so I have no way to meet him behind their backs. I am absolutely dreading telling them that I want to go on a date with someone I met on a dating app because I fear that they will judge me and might even follow me. 

Could you all please help me with my situation? What should I do? What are your thoughts on the relationship? I am worried that I am going to chicken out on just telling them, and I don't want to ghost someone that I could potentially like. I feel like a child for having this problem and want to run awy. To add onto things, I don't have a car of my own. 

TL;DR: I feel controlled and judged by my family, specifically my older brother and sister, for wanting to have a life of my own. Not settling this has come to be a problem for me because I'd like to go on dates, but I feel like I can't because of my family situation. Any advice?

640,e6eiy0,throwRAracism,1575535654.0,1,How do I [21F] as a white woman confront my white boyfriend [24M] over his racist comments?,"I am from a small town which was 10000% white with plenty of casual racism everywhere, and now I live in a city which is diverse and open, which I love. I feel as though I was getting away from the very conservative and judgmental and intolerant South. As I am bisexual, this was also a huge thing in getting away from the homophobia of my high school and feeling content and safe with my real friend group. I work in social work and prioritize equity and feel that people have a moral duty to learn about other people and cultures and treat them respectfully.

My new boyfriend (we met about 2.5 months ago and we are getting along well other than this) is from the (also very white) South and is liberal but pretty uneducated/ignorant about social issues, which he feels guilty about. He is working to learn as far as I know (we only spoke about this a few days ago) and he has asked me how I feel about certain topics relating to politics and social issues, so I believe he does care (or at least he cares that *I* care and that it’s a dealbreaker for me if he’s fine with not learning).

Twice now, he has made comments that made me very  uncomfortable. 

Comment 1, as we are playing Pokemon: 

Him: “You’re good at picking out names. What should I name this Wooloo? It’s a girl.”

Me: “Hmmm, I like the name Yvonne.”

Him: *laughs a little* “That sounds like a black girl’s name.”

(He then didn’t say anything else and had me pick a different name, so I’m 100% sure he was dismissing it and saying he wouldn’t name it Yvonne just because the name “sounded black,” which is..... terrible)

Comment 2, as we are playing Animal Crossing:

Me: “Ooh you got a new villager?? Who?”

Him: “Baabara. She’s fine I guess. She’s totally black, you know? She talks like a black girl. You can tell. Her face is darker than her wool and everything.”

(This one just... Like, what does “talks like a black girl” mean, exactly? Even if this one isn’t as racist as the other, it’s incredibly awkward to say and relies on stereotypes.)

What’s especially frustrating is that the first friend of mine he met was a black girl, who is my best friend and who was extremely friendly and welcoming to him, so it pisses me off especially that he knows her and is saying these very very questionable things when I’m pretty sure he would be too scared to say them around her. If you wouldn’t say it in front of a black person, you clearly shouldn’t be saying it in the first place. 

I’m very upset that he said these things but admit that I should have said something at the time. The first time I was so shocked I just stayed silent and he had to ask me if I was okay. The second time I just awkwardly avoided the topic. I want to confront him but I’m nervous and am unsure of what I can say that won’t escalate the situation or make him shut me out. I know he’s ignorant (and he admits so and that he is learning) but this seems like common sense.

In general he is very people-pleasing and if I so much as sneeze in his direction he apologizes and works to fix the issue, but I also truly want him to understand why it’s upsetting me and why it’s wrong and WANT to stop, not for him to just go “oh, I made her upset, okay, I won’t voice that opinion anymore!” and still have racist thoughts, if that makes any sense. Also, if he ever said anything like that around my friend, I would feel awful for the rest of my life for exposing her to that. 

TL;DR My boyfriend is admittedly uneducated on race and made some racist comments that I want to point out to him, but I’m not sure how to do it. I want to make sure that he really listens and doesn’t feel like I’m just attacking him or lecturing him.",relationship_advice

Some backstory: Im very depressed and Ive been on and off with self harm and suicidal tendencies. The self harm since I was 14 and the suicidal tendencies 16, Im 18 now. Ive started anti depressants now as a last resort because of the girl im in love with. This post is mainly about her but it kind of effects all my friends. 

Like I said im in love with this girl and ive made it my goal to tell her when my mind is more stable or when im happy. The problem is she is constantly worrying about me and trying to help me but is saying she cant be there all the time for me. I dont want her to worry about me, Ive been dealing with my shit longer than Ive known her but she is constantly insisting I get help and as a result Ive been pushing her away saying crap like ""You would be better off without me in your life."". I dont mean what I say obviously but I just want her to be happy, she deserves better than a twat like me. 
Its hard because I just wanna be with her and make her happy but I cant while Im at rock bottom. 

My friends as well, they have all been reaching out to me these last couple of weeks, mainly im assuming because I just havent shown up to college for 3 weeks, but Ive been pushing them away. I love my friends but I dont want to burden them with my shit.

643,e6efhp,throwaway_e5yb4bb,1575534931.0,84,"Advice Please, Boyfriend Thinks I Cheated","Using a throwaway and please excuse any typos as I'm using my phone.

My boyfriend (47M) and I (39F) have been together for 3 years. We are in a long distance relationship, During the beginning of our relationship, there were some trust issues on my end because I saw a text from his ex girlfriend saying how much she missed and loved him. He explained she would send these texts randomly and I forgave him and we moved forward. 

Recently, he found my main Reddit account and saw a comment I made 9 months ago. It was a video of guy saving a turtle from being hit on the road and I jokingly commented, ""But is he single though? 😂"". It was a joke and I really didn't care if he was single or not. Just that he did a nice deed and I joked that with that type of character he wouldn't be single for long. Before he confronted me about the joke, he kept asking me if I ever flirted with anyone online and if I picked up anyone online.  I said no because that joke never crossed my mind since it was 9 months ago. He showed me the comment and called me a liar. I apologized and said it was joke but I should've been more cognizant of his feelings and it wouldn't happen again. 

Since then, he's been on this crusade to prove that I am a cheater. One night, I texted him and went downstairs to make tea. I came back to my phone 15 mins later to see 5 missed calls and a dozen texts claiming I was with someone. I immediately called him back but he wouldn't pick up the phone, just texted to say to continue to talking to my other guy.

In an attempt to prove I wasn't lying about the text incident, I said I would take a polygraph. He sent the polygraph person 5 questions, ""Have I accepted numbers from other men"", ""Have I had sex or sexual contact with any other men"",""Did I have intentions to cheat on him"", ""Did I lie when missing his calls that night"",""Did I have men over my house late at night"".

I failed the first and last question and I'm not sure why. I do have male friends. They seldom come to my house but they have been over around 8pm, they have never spent the night though. The man that administered the polygraph was cold to me from the very start and went so far as to tell my boyfriend that I couldn't be trusted. 
It's just a mess and left me frustrated and angry.

Since then, he has withdrawn. We did one session of therapy and things seemed hopeful.  I went to his state for my birthday for 2.5 weeks and we enjoyed ourselves but today, he told me right before I was to leave for the airport that he installed spyware around his apartment so he can listen to my phone conversations while he was at work and if he found anything incriminating I would not hear from him again. 

I broke up with him. I have not cheated nor am I looking to cheat.  I know how things look but I really haven't.  And I'm angry that he has violated my privacy. He won't find any inappropriate  conversations on the recordings  he has. But he will find several conversations where I'm venting about him. Conversations which I did not want him privy to.  

So Reddit, do I have a right to be upset given the circumstances? 

TLDR, boyfriend thinks I cheated and placed spyware around his apartment to gather evidence.",relationship_advice
644,e6ef9s,throwrawilsonbrenda,1575534893.0,1,Am I the problem?,"So I’ve (f19) been together with my boyfriend (m30) for a little over two years. He’s also the first boyfriend I’ve had. At the beginning, I was fine with doing things with him, aside from sex. But now, I don’t want to do anything. I just feel weird about it. And I don’t know why. About a year ago, while we were fooling around, we had a disagreement over how far I was comfortable going and how far he was comfortable going and I think that was the point where I became uncomfortable doing things. I know it isn’t the age thing, that doesn’t bother me. I met him online a little over 3 years ago and eventually he moved to where I am. We started talking as a couple and were “a thing” before he moved. So when he fooled around with someone, it crushed me. He said he couldn’t go all the way with her because of me. But a few months later, he got with another girl, and did go all the way. He claimed that it was because I wasn’t physically there and he needed that closeness. I was naive and I really wanted things to work with him, and so I worked through it. He hasn’t done anything since he moved here like that, but it definitely still hovers over me a little sometimes. So maybe that’s why I don’t want to do physical things? I love him. There is no doubt about that, no hesitation there, so why do I feel uncomfortable about doing things? It’s tough because I’ve never had anything different so I don’t know what’s normal, what’s not, how I should feel, etc. I’m not sure if maybe I just have a low sex drive? Is it just a me problem or is it him? And lastly, what do I do to work through this? I’ve talked to him about it, and he suggested maybe talking to people to see what they think I should do. Some advice I’ve gotten from someone dear to me was to find out where I stand sexually with him before we get too much further in the relationship because it’s an important aspect of a relationship. I can’t just keep avoiding it out of fear. I don’t want to lose him because I do love him, but I’m not sure it’s fair to either one of us if I don’t want to be together sexually. So I don’t know where to go or who I should talk to from here. Reaching out to reddit is super scary because I don’t know what to expect. But I’ve seen some really helpful comments here, so I could really use some advice. Thank you guys.",relationship_advice

646,e6eaqj,Panshog,1575534035.0,1,UPDATE: My (M23) GF (F24) constantly accuses me of cheating and many other things. I told her about my last post and your responses. She didn’t take it well.,"Hi Folks,

My OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e0flpy/my_m23_gf_f24_constantly_accuses_me_of_cheating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Honestly, I am not so certain where to start. 

After almost all of the comments of my last post told me that I’m in an abusive relationship, I firstly doubted whether I reported things not enough from her point of view, which she later accused me of. 

I told her about the post on the same day and it almost made things even more fucked. She immediately told me how fucked up it is that I’m saying that her behavior is abusive. I’ve told her that I didn’t really see it that way but the posts made me a little uneasy about the whole situation. It kinda escalated further but not as much as one day later, when she started accusing me again. 

Basically, she told me that I am horrible for telling her about her being abusive and then not helping her, or leaving her alone with that. 
I didn’t even leave her alone, I’ve made a bunch of offers like helping her find a psychologist, be there for her and whatnot. The offer regarding a psychologist was taken as an insult, even though she wanted to go a couple times for trust, anxiety and anger issues. 

I felt like shit once again and for the next days we frequently fought again, one time I literally layed on the bed like an embryo and had a flashback to the my childhood (I got physically raped and psychologically abused by my brother). It just felt so similar that the borders started to blurr. This feeling of having 0 control over the situation and constantly getting hurt and then “loved” again was way to similar of a feeling. The next half hour or so was horrible. I screeched, cried my soul out only to forcefully trying to calm down. She stopped telling me how horrible I am and started slowly to stroke me back. It made me crumble even more and it got worse, because on some level, it was very similar to what my brother did. He hurt me in the most horrible ways and made it almost a Sport sometimes, but afterwards somehow managed to make me feel like he actually loves me as his brother and didn’t mean to actually hurt me. 
It was the most perverse thing, because I constantly believed that we were brothers again, but we never really stayed “brothers”.

We kind of made up that night and we were on seemingly good terms. The fight beforehand got really bad. She told me how shitty of a boyfriend I am for not buying her flowers, not always texting back, etc. She completely ignored everything I do on focused only on what I don’t do. This was just the tip of the iceberg though. 
I’m not the flower guy, never have been and I’ve always showed my love my way. I don’t know, maybe I just have to do these things every now and then, but it never struck me as an existential thing. I don’t know, but if my SO wants that, I could try harder to make it happen. 

Things were better for a few days, we had sex, we cuddled, we loved each other. Until yesterday. She texted me at 6am, being kinda cute and such, I headed to Uni at 7:34 and I haven’t answered her until 10am. She texted again and was mad since then. She felt that, because my commute is 1 hour long (train), I could’ve answered and the fact that I didn’t proved that I don’t think of her. I didn’t text much until I got home, because I felt that we should just talk in person. When I came home, she laughed a little but then pushed me away.

It escalated again, she started accusing me of a whole bunch of shit, got madder and madder and kept on insulting me. I tried all kinds of stuff but everything I said was another reason to go batshit crazy on me. She talked about breaking up, which she previously did a lot, but she never really did want to break up. It was more protecting herself. Usually I always kinda got on her side when things went to breaking up, but yesterday she seemed so manipulative, always turning the words in my mouth around, using every little phrase against me and ignoring the important parts. I didn’t put up with it and we split without really knowing what will happen now. She slept on the couch that night and Reddit, I don’t know what to do. This is a wall of text and I hope that some of you actually read it, as I really don’t know what to do. I hope it’s readable, my English isn’t perfect.

I have a crush on a guy I work with and go to school with.  He's tall, a dirty blond, has blue eyes, and facial scruff, my type of guy I'm most attracted to.   Anyways I've had a crush in him for a while now.  Yesterday, we went to go look at Holiday lights together, because we're midwestern Americans and that's seemingly what always happens in December.  We're very close and talk about everything to each other.  

Yesterday, he told me about troubled things from his past and all the past relationships he's been in and how he's very lonely now.  I agreed with being very lonely and told him.about my past relationships too.  We talked about how both sets of parents had been married forever and desperately wanting what they have.  25+ years of marriage and still madly in love.  

Then we went to go hang out and drink sodas together at a little store in the town of our University.   We talked about wanting to find the Carl to our Ellie and vice versa.  We discussed crying at romantic comedies, and all the things that make us similar.

At the end of the night when I dropped him at his dorm he said ,""I love you"" and I said it back.  He's also said ""I love your existence"" to me.

I don’t know how to fix our relationship until I’m able to lose the weight I’ve gained and am not sure how I’ll be able to emotionally handle a year of this.","I didn’t see the rule for the ThrowRA account until I already made this account, so I apologize for any issues it may cause! 

This is going to be long because I’m a bit emotional, but TL;DR: how do I restart our sex life during the next year while I’m losing the weight that is causing my husband to find me unattractive? I’m pregnant currently so I’m just going to keep packing on the lbs for the next 5 months, and we are drifting farther apart because I’m so emotional about it. 

—

My husband and I have been together for 9 years. I was very, very thin as a younger woman and barely weighed 100 lbs at 5”2’ no matter what I ate or did. I had unhealthy habits, even though I was small. 

We married 3 years ago and I was at a great weight of 120 lbs (which he loved!). I still had fairly unhealthy habits but had taken up exercising a bit via kickboxing classes since I had actually started to gain weight. My biggest issue was that I had a chronic pain, which made exercising hard. 

After our wedding, I stopped working out due to the pain. A year later, I had surgery for the issue. Between the surgery, a lifetime of unhealthy habits, and stopping exercising I gained 30 lbs. 

Last year, my husband finally had the courage to tell me he was no longer attracted to me. He still loves me and wants to be with me, he just isn’t physically attracted to me. I didn’t take it well, and for a bit didn’t exercise out of spite. I was so mad at him, because I have self esteem issues already and I had always felt so beautiful when I was with him and he took that away, even though he didn’t mean to. I started working out again slowly, but it barely put a dent in the weight I gained.

We had talked about having a baby and we both wanted it so bad, so we started trying. We tried for 3 months and only had sex when I was ovulating. I finally got pregnant (yay!), but he has only touched me once since (after a few weeks apart due to work). 

I finally brought the issue back up again, and he finds me so unattractive that he doesn’t think we will have sex again until I am able to lose the weight. I told him that realistically that would be a year (5 months left of the pregnancy, 1 month recovery, and probably 6 months to lose 30 lbs?) and he said that was fine. As in, he was fine in not having sex for an entire year. 

It crushes me. I’ve been crying for hours the past 3 nights just thinking about the fact that NOTHING ELSE about me turns him on. That I am so repulsive to him he’d rather just be celibate for a year. I view sex as more than just sex, but as a way to express your love and it’s killing me knowing he’s not going to touch me for a year and I won’t be able to touch him. I’m sad that that part of our relationship is dead, and it’s my fault for gaining the weight. And I am so attracted and in love with him. On top of this next year where we’re going to be celibate (I guess), we had sex maybe 10 times last year since he told me he wasn’t attracted to me, and it had been slowing down before that. 

So, I’m wondering - is there any way to make him more attracted to me despite the weight? Is there anything I can do in the meantime, especially while I’m gaining weight due to the pregnancy and I literally cannot diet, and after while I’m exercising and dieting since weight loss is a slow process? I’ve started walking daily to keep the fat gain under control while pregnant but I know I’m going to have to gain another 30lbs on top of my pre-pregnancy weight that he already didn’t find attractive. I asked him if there was anything I could do, and he said he just doesn’t know. 

I feel miserable, and being miserable around him is obviously not attractive NOR is it good for our relationship. He’s miserable that he’s made me sad, and he just wants to go back to being happy and having fun together. Having our first kid is so exciting and we both just want to have fun being parents in this moment of our life, but I’m having a hard time getting over feeling so ugly. He says I’m still beautiful... but I guess I’m just not sexy. I feel so compartmentalized - the happiest ever because of the baby, and the saddest ever because I’m fat. 

If there’s no way to make him find me more attractive until the weight is gone, does anybody know how to help me get past this sad feeling until we’re back to normal? This just isn’t healthy for me or for him.",relationship_advice
650,e6e8v7,Jacobapple1990,1575533681.0,0,Found texts from my gf to a friend saying she only wanted something physical from a guy she was emotionally cheating on me with...,"the full story about the cheating situation is on an earlier post of mine. But we es moved on from that I think. I mean I have a hard time trusting her still cause of all the lying and things she did but I do love her very much. 
We definitely have a lot less sex than we used to, like it went from having sex like 5 times a week to maybe one. She always has some excuse these days like I’m bloated or I just ate or I’m sleepy or something and she never had these excuses before. 
A couple of weeks ago we took a break and she talked to that guy she liked about how they felt and that they liked each other and almost kissed. This was the day before we took a break. While on the break she was talking to both me and that guy but was talking about how much she missed me and stuff. We got back together and she cane clean about almost kissing and that she liked him and he liked her and then later that week when we already back together she goes to meet him and talk about everything (she told me she was doing this). What she didn’t tell me was that he kissed her on the forehead and she kissed his cheek that day. Later that weekend I accidentally found notes written about what that kiss on the forehead meant to her and it made her feel and how she was going to miss the idea of him and always wander what it would be like. We had a huge argument and she said she wanted me for sure and so I gave her another chance. Don’t call me a doormat it’s just we’ve been through a lot together and she cane to this college cause of me. 
So a couple weeks later (today).... I’m not proud of this cause I want to trust her but I’m still having doubts, but I went through her phone while she was in the shower. I didn’t want to but I did. I wanted to see what her friend said about us and basically they just talked about how we were on a break and that she talked to the guy and how she basically wasn’t breaking up with me for him and stuff and she said he wanted something more with her like a relationship but she just wants a “situationship” whatever that is. And she said that she only wanted something physical with that guy but he wanted more. She’s always told me that she could never do anything with a guy who she wasn’t dating and that she had to be emotionally connected with them and all that bullshit. But obviously she was lying. I mean from what they’ve talked about and texted about they definitely liked each other and they didn’t do anything physical but she obviously wants to cause she said she was attracted to him physically but I didn’t know it was like this. 
So basically what I found out today was that she wanted or still wants to have a physical something with a guy she emotionally cheated on me with and has been lying to me about how she wouldn’t sleep with guys if they weren’t dating and that she’s not having sex with me cause well basically she’s still attracted to this other guy. And I’m guessing my earlier post about her asking me to make her mad by telling her I cheated on her is so that she can feel better about what she wants, not cause it’s some fantasy or kink cause it’s completely new and ive been with her for 2 and a half years and that’s never been something she asked for. I know going through her phone was a major invasion of privacy but the times I have gone through it I’ve always found something like this.",relationship_advice
651,e6e8tx,Oni_Black,1575533674.0,21,I think I (M22) am starting to have a crush on my friend (M27) of 4 years but how can I be sure if it's the first time I have feelings for someone of the same sex?,"This one is a bit long but let me write a quick context.
I know this guy since my first day at my Japanese classes by an ex mutual friend. We got along very well and now that I think about it he is perhaps the only friend whom I feel totally in calm with.


I love girls and women and I always considered myself the romantic gentleman type with them or at least I always tried to be. I've always tested myself to see if I liked boys too but nothing romantic came out of it.


I've always wanted a girlfriend, I had my first one last year for 3 months and I had my first sexual relationship with that same girl. A few months after I broke up with her (due to things not related to my sexuality) I felt as my heart was not beating in a passionate way like it used to at the same time I got a huge hunger for sex (even though in all that time I just had two more sexual encounters) until yesterday that I hung out with this guy and two more friends.


Let's just say that our girl friend was pointing out that I was only chatting with him and being seemingly enthusiastic with him (which I didn't realize) and I hugged him on the neck to bother her.


When it was just the two of us I said sorry for the hug and he told me to not worry, it also didn't seem to disturb him or upset him at the moment.


When I returned home I was really happy in a calmly way for no reason. I started to remember all of that day and I realized a few things I did:


I was insisting him in a jokingly way to play video games at his house saying it was to try his new game, but it was because I could be more time with him and alone with him in his bedroom (not that I was thinking to do anything)


Since the hug, I started imagining myself being embraced by him and every time I do that, my heart beats at least a bit stronger.


I tested myself imagining being in a relationship with him and let's just say that even though I felt embarrassed because we are both men, I felt pretty happy. And that maybe I don't mind kissing him.


I don't do many manly stuff like sports and so but I always tried to define myself as the man who protects his woman from everything he can. But when I imagine myself with him, I also feel pretty happy being, how can you call it?, the ''femenine role''.


I feel really happy imagining myself making him very happy in any way I can at the same I feel really happy being protected by him and being considered the most important thing for him.


I was invited by a girl friend to stay at her house this weekend since her parents will travel and she will be alone to hang out and have ''coffee time''. This guy also said we could play this weekend his new game and yes we'll be alone in his room. I think you could guess which one I am preferring to go.


Every time I tried to deepen my feelings I started to cry for no reason.


Okay, enough context. There are many questions and problems here.
Do I feel a crush on him or is it just a passing thing I don't know from my age, my generation, my environment (my sister is also bi)?

Recently my bf (27) claimed that he had never tried a white claw (and he BARELY drinks and NEVER gets drunk), but had posted 1 month ago on his Facebook “3 am white claw” AND recently I found out that he had been liking pics (including booty pics) and statuses of some girl from his high school on Facebook and Instagram. This girl drinks white claws a LOT. So, my paranoid question is....why would he be posting “3 am white claw” as his Facebook status, saying he’s never tried one, and liking this girls pics and statuses from his high school? Is it paranoid that I think he could be cheating on me?

I became friends with a guy a while ago and we instantly became really close. I only viewed him as a friend and nothing more. (Maybe even a brother) 
It was not until a school trip where somebody asked if we were dating that it hit me..I really wish we were. This confused me as I was SURE I didn’t like him. 
On the drive back we spoke about how we’d be so toxic together (we were joking. We said we’d be toxic because we both CONSTANTLY roast each other) and spoke about how we Both don’t want kids . He started referring to me as his wife when I said we argue like old married couples. He began to poke fun at some stuff I said and how I react and stuff. At that time I knew we were just pretending and this will all be over the next day .
Boy I was wrong.
It’s been some weeks now since that trip and since then we have been constantly referring to each other as if we are a couple. He told me he’s gonna ask me out for prom. He’s told me that I’m pretty SO many times. He held my hand a couple of times too . He’s like when I compliment people it’s not as strong as when I compliment YOU.  We’re ALWAYS together and even more people ask if we’re together.  He’s not embarrassed when people start labeling us as a couple , in fact he doesn’t mind at all.
Now all of these signs seem like he likes me right? (Unless I’m dumb)  but then he does things like wants to have other friends around when we hang sometimes. Talks about how if he gets a girlfriend he wouldn’t abandon me. Says “i don’t like anyone / her”   And just acts like I’m in the friend zone and now I have proper feelings for him. 
At this point I’m just terrified.. is this all pretend to him? Am I falling for nothing? Is none of this real and it’s all just pretend? Does he actually  not like me and is doing this all as part of the joke we have going on? 
I’m so scared to even tell him I like him. 
Once he sent me a msg saying “ Sometimes I wish I could tell you how much I wanna be next to you, but I’m too busy to let our bond flourish” 
Yesterday he stayed indoors with me because I didn’t wanna go outside with the rest of our gang.
I’m so scared because I’m proper falling for this dude and idk if it’s reciprocated or it’s all a joke.

655,e6e7he,Global-Yogurtcloset,1575533417.0,3,I (26M) am still trying to understand the root of my ex’s (30F) jealousy issues.,"I began casually dating my ex in the summer of 2017, and became official during the fall of that year. We were incredibly physically attracted to each other and had a FWB relationship that whole summer, and after spontaneously traveling overseas together for a week she asked me why we weren’t official. This led to an hour long conversation and we became an “official” couple. 

We had a roller coaster of a relationship, great sex and physician attraction, but frequent arguments. Somehow we dated up until the fall of 2018, when I then broke up with her the day before my 25th birthday. We talked for about 4 hours about how much we argue, which led to tears, and we agreed to go our separate ways. The way we interacted with each other stressed me out beyond belief and I hardly saw my friends for all of 2018. This relationship had consumed my life.

We barely communicated the rest of 2018, but in early 2019 we agreed to meet up and grab coffee as friends. We had coffee, went back to her place, then had sex. Shortly thereafter, we were casually dating again. Not surprisingly, after a week long honeymoon stage, the same old problems began to reappear.

First, we went to a sushi restaurant. While enjoying dinner, the door swung open (which had bells on it) and I briefly looked over, and my girlfriend asked why I looked the girl who walked in up and down. I literally looked at the door and right back at my food. 

A couple weeks later, we went to the movies and when I came out of the bathroom, my girlfriend asked what I was looking at. I didn’t know what she was talking about, and she said “Why did you look at the girl that walked by?” I don’t even remember seeing a girl and I was looking at the ground and on my phone the entire time I came out of the bathroom.

I picked her up at Target one day after work and as I was backing out my car, she said “Is there something you want to go back and see over there?” And I said “sorry?” And she said “there was a cute girl that went by on roller skates. I don’t blame you for looking.” It was 9pm and night and I didn’t even see anyone, I was focusing on backing out my car and looking at Google maps to see directions to the restaurant we were driving to.

We ended up breaking up for a second time after a few months of trying things again because I followed an Instagram model/influencer who, and I quote, “looks like the girl that I was checking out at the movie theater”.

Clearly our relationship was not meant to be, but I am trying to understand how her perception of the world is so different than mine. The negative energy and jealousy that plagued our relationship still affects me to this day, and we have been been broken up (after our second relationship attempt) since March 2019).

658,e6e57v,StormieTheCloud,1575533003.0,3,Is the end near for us or am I overreacting?,"Me (21F) and my boyo (21M) have been together for three years. The first one basically living together (lives in the same coed dorm) and the second two basically on other sides of the county. 

Everything has been pretty okay, normal dumb long distance stuff until I dropped out. It made me feel the worst I’ve ever felt in my life staying so I decided I would take a break for a bit. My boy is very adamant about an education. His mother didn’t get one and he sees her struggling for their family as a school bus driver. He sends them money month to month. Finishing schools is one of his principles and he was extremely disappointed in me but supports me for now. He says we both have to take care of ourselves and that I can’t expect him to support me in the future if I want to go back to school and that I need to carry my weight (essentially) in the future. Understandable and agreeable. 

So I got two jobs. I don’t have a day off and work 50+ each week. I love working and money so I don’t mind however I am a terrible multitasker and of course in my jobs I can’t be on my phone so I could go hours without texting him. However I do tend to forget to respond back anyway even in downtime. One day I forgot to respond for 6 hours. 

I feel incredibly terrible about not texting him but with my distracted easily ass I can’t afford to lose concentration or I lose out on tips. 

And then we had a huge fight. Honestly we’ve never really fought with each other. We are both pretty lax people which I’ve come to find out is that we just don’t like sharing our feelings. We yelled and screamed at each other. My boy told me how it feels like I’m just a friend visiting when I do. That the conversations I have with him are menial, stupid, and he wants more interesting convos besides “how was your day”. He asked my why I was crying saying “there is nothing to cry about” like he didn’t basically tell me he didn’t love me anymore. He shut down after that. Contradicting everything he just said. 

Ever since then I’ve noticed a decline in respect for the smallest things. He would make snide comments about how I didn’t know something but would seemingly set up traps to where I would have to say I didn’t know. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/VVRmggK) is a text convo we just  had. I don’t play DnD or anything like that and he definitely knows this.  The text could be something I’ve overblown but I can’t help but feel the affection he had for me fading. 

I’m definitely feeling burned out but that just manifests itself in me as well. I just don’t know if my feeling are justified or if I’m just overreaching.",relationship_advice

Idk if it came off as rude because I told him I wasn’t angry, just wanted to be honest. He didn’t reply after that and he had read the message. What should I do? Should I explain to him? To be rude wasn’t my intention at all :(

Even more of a backstory, me and my boyfriend were FWB for around 5-6 months off and on and he would vent and tell her everything that happened between the two of us (as you would to any of your best friends, I did the same) and during that time both my partner and I did some pretty crazy and shitty things to one another, which obviously formed a perception of the kind of person his girl friend thought I was. In 2015, when my boyfriend and I finally made it offical, she refused to get to know me, spoke poorly of me to mutual friends where it then circulated back to me and my partner and even bitched about me to my boyfriend, where he basically just took it and didn’t defend me or tell her off - which basically made her think her behaviour could continue..which it did. So, 8 months into our relationship I had yet to officially meet her and make the formal “hi my name is...” and I told my boyfriend my discomforts. He gave her an ultimatum and that was to get to know me or he couldn’t be friends with me anymore. He expressed this to her with her turning around and stating she wasn’t ready and did not wish to meet with me. 

They stopped being friends - but she’s popped up here and there over the past year or so whether that be my boyfriend bumping into her near his work (she works nearby), or she has been at events we have been at where she’s acted inappropriate and super disrespectful to me, with apology to my boyfriend  that followed the next day via phone call to my partner.

So, that aside today she called him and basically said she wants to catch up with him. I’m not sure if that included me, but by what my boyfriend said, sounds like only him and her. I’m stuck at a crossroad because I don’t want to be the overly emotional girlfriend who stops my partner from who he hangs out with but I am truthfully so uncomfortable and bitter about this girl and her behaviour in the past, and how I’ve given her multiple chances to try and have some kind of relationship with me yet continued to snob me off, disrespect me as treat me like shit. 

What should I do? I feel like my boyfriend has told me because he’s leaving it in my hands, but apart of me wishes he could realise the effect it’s all hand on me to even ask consider this meeting with her.

For as long as I can remember there has been problems in my house.
So... my mom and my brother doesnt get along too well. My brother doesnt get along with most of my family tbh. Me on the other hand, no matter how much I love or hate anyone dont show it out and mostly hold it within me.. Tensions have been rising throuhh the years and I cant live between the stress and its fucking eating my head.  To give you a vague idea of what is happening I can tell you the most recent incident  

So one day I wake up and the first thing I hear is my mom and brother arguing about some shit and both of them lost it. My mom asked my brother to leave the house and which he did. We had to search for hours to find him, talk some sense to him and get him back to the house. My mom say the issues are with my brother and my brother says otherwise. My brother thinks my mom is partial to me (he never tells me that, and he is perfectly fine with me), I came to know about it through his friends. 

And my problem is whenever they argue about something they call me in between and asks what he haid and what she said? Whos fault is it???

664,e6e3va,Current_Zombie,1575532759.0,4,He (23M) broke up with me (23F). Can I win him back? Anyone with similar experiences?,"Yesterday he broke up with me after 4 years, 2 of which was an LDR. He said that all our little arguments since the middle of this year started to build up, as he felt like he was always giving in to my requests and he wasn't getting anything in return. For example, I would ask him why he wasn't putting in more effort i.e. requesting for more Skype sessions or being more present. After our little arguments, he would just agree to put in more effort. Finally came the moment where he questioned why he was doing this at all and felt like he had no feelings for me anymore. He has a history of keeping things to himself, and as I look back, it's either he was giving me hints which I could not get or he did not tell me at all. 

I tried to convince him to give me a chance to rekindle what we had, but he did not want to. His point being that he has no feelings for me already. However, he still values what we had and still cares for me and I feel the same for me as well. He expressed that he still wants me to be a part of his life as friends, but he'll wait for me to heal and calm down before we go back to being friends. 

I admit I can be rather outspoken with what I want and need, and he tends to be more passive. Perhaps this clouded my judgement and how I saw things. I'm afraid I slowly pushed him away, though he says he can't blame me. I know I need to heal from the heartbreak but I want to improve myself and show him that I have become a better person in the hopes that it would spark his feelings for me again. 

Am I being delusional or too hopeful? Should I just drop that hope of getting him back? It is my first relationship but I was so happy to have him in my life, even with the distance. I would love some advice on what to do moving forward and if you have a personal experience, I would really appreciate it if you could share it with me.",relationship_advice

I’m not a huge fan of TikTok. I just recently downloaded the app and I think a lot of it is extremely cringe. There’s a few good ones here and there and a few interesting ones I really like. But for the most part I don’t get lip-syncing a comedy scene, like why not watch the actual scene instead of a 15 year old girl mouthing along to it in her bedroom? Anyway, I fully admit that it’s just not for me but I can see the appeal for some people. Some things like those “I live in a mansion check” or the general flexing is toxic, but oh well it’s just not for me. 

She’d send me some TikToks here and there and then get frustrated when I don’t laugh. We like other shows and movies and stuff that we watch, but TikTok we just don’t agree on. It was fine when she would send me random ones because I just wouldn’t watch them. But now she makes them and asks for feedback and I don’t know how to tell her I think they’re dumb. I don’t want to sound like a dick, but my honest opinion is that they’re dumb. 

I don’t think it’s bad to think they’re dumb, I look at memes and stuff all day that I know she thinks are dumb. And that’s fine, I just get that they’re not for her and I don’t send her a million of them.

How do I deal with it? I don’t want to put down her interests, but I think it’s totally fair to not be into the same things and I think it’s also fair to think some things are just stupid. What should I do?

I assume this because she’s also expressed that they’ve always been naked around each other. When I finally expressed over time that some of their behavior makes me uncomfortable, despite his sexual orientation, she assures me that he does not have feelings emotional or sexual towards her, but admitted to having a threesome with him one time in order to help him get laid by a straight man he was interested in (years before we met).

668,e6e1dl,RuneQ,1575532285.0,2,Am I(23F) unreasonable for expecting my boyfriend(32M) to stand up for me behind my back against inappropriate comments ?,"So my boyfriend and I are dating for almost two years now(before that we were best friends for about a year) and we work together for the same company in the same department. No one knows and we try keep our relationship private and keep things professional at work. Majority of the staff are males and I am a generally friendly person so I will greet and chat to everyone. Just before my BF left, a new male(Lets call him Jonny) joined the team and we all became friends almost instantly. This male is engaged (I even help set up the day he proposed) and we have all gone out dancing on two or three occasions.He knows we are dating. Naturally when my BF left ,I started hanging out with Jonny during the day/at lunch.

Now 5 months later,when my boyfriend returned to work ,the other guys started making jokes saying things like ' she replaced you' ect. According to my BF, these jokes have now turned sexual. Our agreement was that I would stop hanging out at Jonny's workstation,I would confront someone when they make a comment like that in my presence(After on one occasion I failed to react appropriately)  and he would stand up for me when I am not there. Now that the opportunity arose , he feels that he cant say anything because they aren't aware we are dating .I have said many times we should just come clean and tell people, he says its not a good idea because it will influence the way his boss treats him and his workload. 

 Since then my BF has asked me to not hang out with other males in our department and stay away from Jonnys work station because the jokes make him upset. Which is understandable,but I don't believe it will resolve the issue until its dealt with in a means of confronting the people making said jokes. But I do so anyway. My contact with other males is limited.  A few mornings ago,I was outside and Jonny came outside for a smoke. Another male saw that we were talking and apparently made a inappropriate comment to my BF regarding where and with whom I'll be spending my evening,to which my BF only comment was 'No'. Now he is angry with me because I was talking to Jonny and 'should've known better'. I was unaware that when he asked me to stop hanging out at Jonnys work station, he actually meant to stop talking to Jonny and everyone else all together.

 I have since then taken it into my own hands and confronted the male who had apparently made these comments,not to my surprise ,he denied it. I have also asked other people about alleged jokes , everyone claims to know nothing.  Also, he conversed with one of his close friends about the situation and she said it might be a good idea to tell people we are in a relationship . Now he all of a sudden agrees.

On the other hand, I have always been a very sexual person (jerking 2 - 5 times per day when I was younger, down to 1 - 3 times every other day or so now) I still have a very high drive but sex never really had much reward to it (growing up having sex was like the holy grail of being a guy, when I lost my virginity it didn't feel as great as everything I read or had been told, I guess I'm still chasing that dream) when we first started dating we had sex a lot. but now she would rather be intimate without being sexual. I on the other hand am still very sexual but when we do have sex I don't really get much out of it, I haven't been able to cum for the past year (but I can get off fairly quickly from porn)

I can't help but get a little handsy which just pisses her off and often leads to and argument (I take full responsibility). About a year ago she got the birth control the is implanted into the arm and lasts for 7 years, we are working on getting state insurance and getting it removed due to health concerns (she's constantly bleeding and having other help complications that may be caused by the implant). I want to find a way to lower my sex drive so that I can been a better partner and stop upsetting her.

I guess something else is that some times I wish I was Single, I get so tired of dealing with day to day relationship stuff with almost no reward, but I know that if I loose my girlfriend I will never get her back, how do I get these thoughts out of my head?",relationship_advice
674,e6dxjr,DeleteInTheMorning,1575531575.0,1,I overthink and feel like I become overbearing when I like a girl,"\[ThrowRA\] Sorry, I'm super new to this and I just read the rules after posting.

&#x200B;

Hey everyone,

So I'm a guy in my last year of college and pretty new to dating but I've recently hooked up with and gone on several dates with a girl of a mutual friend in the course of a month.  This dates have been mostly fine though a bit awkward because I get a bit nervous and my mind blanks out when I'm with her. But I think I really really like this girl, and I'm kind of scared of it.

I didn't really like her like that in the beginning but as we hung out, she really grew on me and I enjoy being around her. But when we went on our last date, I got the feels for her and I think I told her that. Now I'm not exactly sure what to do with my feelings. Despite my best efforts to act/think as normal as possible, I'm starting to think about her all the time and my knee-jerk response is to go [full Boyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCH2ROnh6Ls). I know that's way too overbearing/cringey/immature and I think that partly stems from my nervousness of dating and feeling like I might ""lose"" her. But that also puts me in a position where I'm constantly second-guessing myself, if I'm doing too much or too little.

So my question is, how do I get myself to stop overthinking, stop getting obsessed, and just be the normal me I am when I am not trying to date?",relationship_advice
675,e6dwyk,spookyjuniper,1575531476.0,3,Boyfriend’s sister is inconsiderate and does not take responsibility.,"Hi everyone, I don’t know if this is the correct forum to post on, please let me know if not. 
Me (21) boyfriend (24) have been living together for over 2 years now, I’ve known him for much longer, since I was 14, and his family about 4 years. As of right now, I live with his family because I was in a rough spot where I was, but anyways, I’ll get back to the story. His sister is 19, and takes no responsibility for her actions. 

Currently I’m attending school as well as working full time. My boyfriend has his own business, as well as works at his parents restaurant doing deliveries when needed. We both pay his parents for rent, cook our own food, clean up after our selves, do laundry, etc. 

When I first met his sister, we had an OK relationship. Me and her have never really clicked. She seeks advice from me as a big sister, as well as confides in me when needed. The problem that arises is that she is used to getting everything handed to her, has no sense of the worth of $1, has no skills what so ever, becomes the victim when you tell her something, she throws a tantrum like a child, (becomes the victim), blames you for why she is the way that she is, starts slamming doors, swearing, cussing out her own parents, telling them they should die, that if she died they would be better off without her, that they’ve never loved her, they’ve never given her anything. 

She works part time at her family’s restaurant doing deliveries as well. She works about 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, Monday - Friday. She gets paid tips, her fathers tips (large catering orders) as well as $250 every 2 weeks. Total probably about a full time minimum wage job for less than half of the work. By the end of the week, all her money is gone, she asks her parents for more money. The car she uses is about $7,000, that her parents told her they wouldn’t get for her (high school) unless her grades went up, her grades did not, she graduated almost lowest of her class, when they said no car, she threw a tantrum another time, then they bought her the car. 

Recently she got a $1,200 ticket for reckless driving (parents paid) and other, she has lost her key (over $300), scratched the car, got a whole paint job, scratched it again, new bumper, etc. she has had the car maybe a year? (Doesn’t take care of her things what so ever)


This is where she is inconsiderate, mainly small things that she doesn’t seem to understand. 
Takes a shower, everything falls off the shelves (doesn’t pick it up) razors fall, we cut our feet stepping on them because we don’t see them, when the things in the bathroom do drop, she leaves the containers open, everything spills out, shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc. btw, she does NOT pay for anything that is a necessity, everything is either paid by her parents, or my boyfriend and I. She will use last of toilet paper, doesn’t refill. 
Kitchen, she doesn’t know how to cook, I love cooking, I’ve made many meals for her. When I cook, she doesn’t wash the plate, I do. (I tell her nothing because it will cause an issue) she talks to me about how she is, in her words, “I went on a date last night, I don’t think he liked me though, probably because of how I look. “ I tell her, “what do you mean?” She says, “because I’m fat and ugly, nobody wants me, *fake cry noise* I’m going to my room” 

I’ve told her many many times she is beautiful and shouldn’t base her worthiness on how someone else views her. 


A month before thanksgiving, her brother and her had a competition to see who can lose the most weight, (a month went by, she lost) the competition was whoever can lose the most weight in one month, the loser has to pay the winner $100. She said “no you said who can lose 20lbs in one month, I’m not paying you shit, you know what the competition said” “ I swear on my moms life that’s what you said” (his sister always jokes with me, plays around, has fun) 
I was making hot coco and asked who wanted some, his mother, grandma, him and sister were there. she said she did, so I said “ok , if you want some you have to pay your brother “ everyone laughed... but her. She stormed out the kitchen swearing, saying she was leaving. Her mother went after her asking why she’s doing this, they’re outside thanksgiving morning screaming (LET IT BE KNOWN, the whole time in the kitchen everyone was helping cook , BUT his sister) screaming her mother doesn’t love her, etc , (like the same tantrum lines over again) 
His mom comes back in crying her eyes out, saying why would she bet on my life, she doesn’t care, she has a bad attitude, etc.  I felt so bad so I told her I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean anything bad, or anything bad to happen, we joke around all the time. The mom said you didn’t do anything wrong, she needs to learn to fix her attitude, etc. but she was crying her eyes out. 


So these are just a few occasions of what is going on... there are many more, this happens on a every so week basis. 

I’m writing this post because it was 11 pm at night, I have school in the morning, and work, so does my boyfriend. She is in the kitchen with her cousin screaming, yelling, laughing at the top of her lungs, right next to our bedroom, and running. This happens every. single. night. Some mornings I get up at 4 am for work. 
I was fed up, so I got out of the bedroom, they were almost out the door, I say “hey guys, can you please stop yelling? We are very tired and have work in the morning” 

Well, she didn’t like the sound of that. She stared at me and slammed the door shut and left. She didn’t say one word to me. 

With her, when she is angry, she will give you the silent treatment until YOU apologize, even if you did nothing wrong. 

On thanksgiving I sat down with her mother , the sister came inside and I said, I’m really sorry for what happened earlier, I didn’t mean to upset you, I thought we were all just joking around, she said “it’s fine” and walked away. 

She is able to tell me many mean things, but I can’t tell her anything. I was in sweatpants, a t shirt, and my hair was up. I was with my boyfriend heading to the mothers room to ask her a question, the sister was there and said out of nowhere, “you look like a dike” I didn’t even know what to say. I don’t think I even said anything, I think I just left because if I said anything, it would be my fault, in her eyes. 
She has also told her friends “she eats like a pig and she is still so small” I overheard because I was coming out the bedroom to use the restroom and she was talking so loud in the kitchen, she didn’t even think about how loud she was. 
She has made me feel bad about having a fast metabolism, we went out with his mother father and her bother and her. We all got a burger and fries from this really good restaurant. Out of nowhere she says to me, “it must be really nice to eat all that and not gain weight” (for the record, her father is just as small as me) after a few times throughout a year of her telling me that, her mother finally told her she can’t tell me those things anymore because I was telling her mother that I don’t like how she speaks to me. 
She says little things to make you very upset and feel bad about yourself and give her pity. 
She does nothing at all to change her diet or her lifestyle. She does not exercise, she does not eat any vegetables what so ever. She is technically obese. 

I really need help, I don’t know what to do. Any advice will be really appreciated. Please let me know if I’ve left out any important details.

Edit: she has also taken my car without my permission, got fast food with her friends, left the food in my car overnight and spilled soda in my back seat and did not clean it.",relationship_advice

That's my job."" and a very strong ""I don't need yours ."" Ironically enough, it makes me feel like less of a woman, lonely, and ignored in the relationship (among other issues we have)

To me part of being in a long-term committed relationship is confiding in each other and asking each other for input. Whether it's 'What do you think of my shirt/this team?' or ""What should I do in xyz situation"" or even ""How does that make you feel."" I guess as an alpha male, maybe he would see this as a sign of weakness? He has a pretty headstrong personality, but definitely many moments where I get to see through that wall.

Some background; We are in a LDR, been dating for almost 3 years now. We talk everyday and only seen each other once. Before and during our 1st year of dating I was in a bad place and she helped me a lot which I’m super thankful for. But during that time I was a different person and said things at the time I wanted or liked, which I no longer do. For an example, having children. A lot of stuff I don’t remember saying but she keep all our texts and loves to show me them. Please keep in mind I was in a dark place. So I’ve told her that I’ve changed my mind on a lot of things but she doesn’t want to except it. So most of the time when we talk we just argue and argue. I’m the person that likes to step away and think about stuff, wait until things calm down, she isn’t. It’s coming to the point where I’m just sick of the fighting along with her neediness and jealousy of everyone and everything in my life, which isn’t much. She constantly brings up my ex to tell me how I did this and that with her, thinking I loved my ex more. Bringing up how she doesn’t like certain family members of mine and if I’m with them blows up. Telling me I’m not romantic enough with her, which I try to please her all the time and do what she wants more but it isn’t enough. Lately it’s getting to the point were I can’t stand talking to her. She makes things so miserable. I’m not one to go and start arguments but not In her case. We will be having a good time when all of a sudden she is pissed at something I did in the past, future or present. Which is normally me teasing or making a joke that sets her off then its on and she goes off about everything. As I said I don’t want kids due to how the world is becoming and tbh I don’t want to be responsible for kids. But she’s always forcing it down my throat along with getting married and how next time I see her I better propose and have a ring. She’s always telling/hinting at marriage which tbh I’m not ready for do to personal reasons. But that still doesn’t stop her from always being on my case. Then comes her neediness, she won’t give me my space even when we’re in a LDR, we always have to talk most of the day which I don’t mind until we start arguing then I hate it. She’ll start crying if I’m away with someone else or by myself cause she thinks I care more about them or don’t want to talk, which isn’t the case. If I’m busy I’m busy. She also thinks I’m going to abandon her and thinks I don’t love her. It’s just becoming mentally draining and I’m afraid of breaking up with her cause she’s threaten to do something stupid like hurting/killing herself. Which I don’t want to happen ever! I feel trapped. Don’t get me wrong I love her with all my heart, I just don’t like the drama, arguing, jealousy and being told I better propose to her. Idk what to do or how I can fix our relationship. 

Also I know I’m far from perfect, I know I said that I wanted things then have changed me mind, I can come off as distant at times. I don’t want you think I’m sort of saint cause I’m not nor is anyone.",relationship_advice

681,e6dqid,Shellybellywok,1575530350.0,1,My (F24) fiance (M26) and I no longer enjoy being intimate together.,"Sorry this is a mess, I'm on mobile.

We've been together for almost 8 years, we've  had sexual problems since our first time together. I think our situation is unique since we both went through trauma at 13yrs old. His happened when he went skiing with some friends from school, one of the friends threw a chunk of ice at his groin as a joke. He apparently sustained nerve damage from this. For a large portion of our relationship he was obsessed with feeling/not feeling much sensation when we're sexual. He's been to a lot of neurologists and other doctors who've told him he's fine but he is obsessed about sensations.. and when I was growing up I was physically and sexually abused by my stepfather leading to my rape at 13. So sex has always been difficult for us.. but 5yrs ago we moved in together and I discovered he has an addiction to porn. He had hundreds of bookmarked videos all categorized by the actress or style of video.. so I took this extremely personal and feel like he's not into me because I'm nothing like the chicks in his saved vids. We've been going to therapy together the last year to work through this.. but recently I've just not wanted to be intimate with him at all.. I don't feel comfortable around him. I feel as though I'm not what he wants/ he's not attracted to me..or it's always one sided. He makes my needs feel like a chore. We haven't had sex since beginning of October. 

Tonight he tried to initiate intimacy.. but I'm on my period and he knows I am. So I got frustrated because he didn't communicate with me before that he wanted to tonight and I felt like since he knew its shark week for me then he'd be off the hook for my needs.. he then said that he just doesn't ever enjoy sex with me. He literally said that.. I feel so defeated..

Outside of sexual things we're great. He's my best friend. We've been enjoying playing the new pokemon game together and rewatching starwars before the new movie comes out. He's very helpful around the house and with our pets and picking up my slack while I'm about to graduate college/ busy with finals. 

I don't know if we should just call the quits on this? We have so much history and I really don't think I am capable of starting over with someone else.. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: fiance and I no longer feel comfortable being intimate together. Tonight after a failed attempt he said that he's never enjoyed sex with me..",relationship_advice

683,e6dop7,Xylemine,1575530031.0,0,"My [20M] Girlfriend [19F], insists we should go on a 1 week break to help recoup ourselves.","So this all started a few months ago actually, before yall go through my history of posting and everything, know that i tend to ask and post the negative sides of our relationaship only, because thats where i need help most, this does not mean we are unhappy, we are horrible tgt and stuff. 

Rs - 1 year 5months 

So few months ago my girlfriend started feeling really off to me, she would message lesser, meet me lesser, and even when we do meet, her energy is just not the same, few months in, i shifted house to relatives, with 3 kids that cling to me, so i was busy everyday morning to night, but i still texted her every hour, and minutes, yet she claimed that thinfs are different between us and im not free to text her when i do even when im extremely busy, but on the otherhand if she is busy, i am supposed to understans, yes very one sided in terms of this and it pisses me off, she did admit she feels immature about it.

Few more weeks in she tells me AGAIN no more sex till marriage (ps. If you compare to my old posts, we did have sex, on her choice and mine, several times already), i told her fine, you afraid of it, ill comply, but what irked me was she brought out splitting as an option because i wont be able to handle it when i can and i have, what irks me even more is how she changes her decision in a snap everytime, and im always the victim, when she brought this up i knew we were heading for something bigger soon, and she wanted to split for a different reason but she just couldnt tell me.

A week later we were supposed to meet up for a date followed by some private time for us, and she said idk if i should, to summarize the beating around bushes, she did not want to even be doing anything sexual with me (we did nth sexual for the past months although i tried intiating, she would always change topic), she claimed it is sinning and she does all this l, although she prays (muslim, religious fam), but im wondering, why now, why suddenly, 1st she tells me i cant handle no sex so we shud split now its no sexual activity, i just feel obviously there is something up and she wants to leave me and using all these extras as an excuse, i told her she dont find me attractive or love me anymore but she claimed she still is and does love me, but i dont believe her, there is a clear problem on her side and i feel a lack of love and effort coming from her.

A few days later we had some weird arguement, and she said she wanted to break up, and I was taken by shock and so strange, i reminded her of all we wanted to and what we had to accomplish tgt and how we can work this out, but if you have decided i respect it, she decided then we shud take a 1 week break, today is the 3/7 days, she was very loving and explaining that we will be better again and we will come back stronger, but i am here thinking... from no sex, no sexual activity, no meeting, to breaking up, and now break, she really does not love me like she says she does (assuming, but maybe she does love me). If you need a break from someone to realise if you love them means you dont love them, plain and simple, yes she is a person who needs alot of alone time and i understand, this break might work for her, but through this break im growing very resentful and pissed at her actions because i realise she has been unfair to me throughout the past few months. 

Insecure thoughts are running through my mind, is there another guy, does she not love me, is she talking to other guys now, has she really moved on, was i holding her back from happiness? 

Before everyone claims to just end it now and stuff, please explain why, because i am willing to try and fix, wheares she is running and giving up.

She is hiding something for sure, and once the break ends, we will have a proper talk on what happened and what the fk is happening with her, i can solely say, most arguements start from her, because im just chilling here being me doing what we love suddenly she raises a question like... maybe we arnt meant for each other.. im like, women, what?? we literally laughed, texted, sexy timed, and kissed for the past weeks what is wrong...yeah theres that.


Tl;dr - Girlfriend went from no sex, to no sexual activity, to breakup, to 1 week break, it may be working for her, but i am growing very resentful, she is a big reason of our arguements, and i am confused of why she is doing this, insecure thoughts,  maybe seeing another guy, doesnt love me. 3/7 days into the break, and im dying inside and want to clear up the issues now instead of running.

What the fk should i do now, i do not want to end it here.

Edit: just additional info of how i am feeling now, im literally just sitting around, doing what i have been doing even before the break, and when we first got tgt, playing games, working out, making websites, designing, this feels like the meme of the guy in the bed thinking of something stupid while the girl thinks like ""he must be cheating on me"" while the guy is like ""what happens if my dick erects into a water bottle?""  Bs aside, im a really calm and chill guy, i just want us to work right, it doesnt have to be this hard 🤷‍♂️",relationship_advice

We met over summer and decided to give long distance a shot, since we kicked it off so well. I drive 6 hours one way to see her once a month. We were FaceTiming and she’s telling me about her post so I decided to google it and look. She has told me in the past she doesn’t want me to know about her reddit. She knew I was looking for it and didn’t think I’d find it in such few minutes. She was mad I found it. On it I found her talking about wanting to be bisexual or lesbian.  I’m not one to judge for sexuality but cheating is cheating no matter what their sex is. Idk if the best time to explore your sexuality is in a relationship. If you want to be with someone else simply don’t be with me. It’s not fair to me as a partner. I also found her trying to sell underwear which was my breaking point. I wouldn’t be mad if she would’ve just told me straight up “I need to make money” but 2 weeks before the post I found messages between her and a sugar daddy (she claims to have never met). She said she would never do anything like it again but here we are again. I really love this girl but I’m not for sure if I should be in this relationship. I hate lies and they really start to make me question everything a person says. I have stressed the importance of honesty in this relationship SO MUCH. I want to believe that she is serious but how many chances can I give a person. Our relationship is usually really healthy. But times like this make me feel unwanted. I want to be with her so bad, but I don’t want to get back with her again just to reinforce this type of behavior. She cries to me begging me back every time I catch her. I have told her I’m going to be much more understanding if you tell me straight up what you’re doing, if I find out on my own it’s going to be a big deal.

I have moved on, or tried to at least. A year later I met a great man who since then have show me genuine love and comfort.

He treats me wonderfully, he respects me, and he actually enjoys spending time with me. We’ve already talked about hypothetical long-term plans for our future. We both want to kill each other sometimes, like any couple, but our relationship is a happy and solid one. 

He told me several months ago that for various reasons his birthdays have always ended up being complete disasters and he’s never enjoyed them. I knew right away that I wanted to give him a good one this year to break the pattern. 

The problem is, for a number of personal reasons that aren’t relevant to this question, I have almost no money to work with. I’m about as paycheck to paycheck as I can get, and I’ve been working on building my savings back up but realistically I likely won’t be able to have “extra” money to spend at least until the new year. I’ve been wracking my brain trying to come up with something special to do for him to make his birthday not suck, but I’m seriously struggling to come up with any ideas that don’t involve me spending money I don’t have. 

Just as a preemptive answer to some possible questions, no, he is not pressuring me in any way to give him a good birthday this year. This is something I’m stressing out about entirely on my own because I want to make him happy, and I feel that as his girlfriend I have a responsibility to at least try to give him a good birthday for once. 

So, Reddit, how can I make my boyfriend’s birthday enjoyable and memorable on a seriously small budget?",relationship_advice
688,e6dmop,iffygo,1575529692.0,3,Is It Right To Break Up With Someone Over The Little Things?,"BEFORE YOU COME TO YOUR CONCLUSIONS, no I don't plan on breaking up with my boyfriend over little things. However, I just want to know if it's normal to consider a break up if you can't stand the little things that your partner does. For example, my ex used to never come on time to any of our plans. In fact, he would always come half an hour late. That is something that I would consider a ""little thing"" because as compared to something like cheating, obviously they don't compare, you know? I'm sure you get what I am saying.

NOW, in regards to my current relationships, there are certain things that urk me about him that I don't necessarily like. For one, sometimes when he speaks he gives off this attitude. I've learned over time that it's just the way he speaks because even his friends do it, but when we get into fights it really comes off in such a rude way and really escalates the argument even more. Another thing he does it that he is really bad at reassuring me. Whenever he has a problem and he talks to me about it, I feel like I'm really great with trying to comfort and understand him. But when the roles are switched, all he can say is ""Oh, I see,"" or ""I understand."" Like ... thanks? This isn't to say that my boyfriend isn't a great guy. He's really sweet and very loving, but I'm not sure as to whether or not it would be fair to leave someone because of these little things or that we should learn to accept these little things. I have also talked to him about this so he is aware of how I feel. 

Would you break up with your SO because of a little thing that was however important to you? Have you broken up with someone because you couldn't take it with their ""little behaviours?"" Am I wrong for feeling this way? In relationships, are we supposed to accept them even for the little things?

NOTE: I have had dating experience before. I am just asking because I overthought this and now I don't even have a straight forward opinion of my own. Someone give me their two cents on this!",relationship_advice

694,e6dhyn,LigeiaPo,1575528890.0,1,Friend thinks my [28/M] boyfriend is abusive [24/F],"I'll preface this by saying I was in a extremely abusive relationship prior to this one, from the ages of 17 to 21. Emotionally, sexually and physically. 

Lately I have had a lot of arguments with my boyfriend. We actually broke up for a while then got back together. To me it seems like he is under stress from work and problems he is having with his family. And while I don't think that means he shouldn't be held responsible for any bad behaviour, I do think we're all human and stress can make you behave differently. 

Anyway I was telling my friend that my relationship is getting me down lately and how he isn't really the person he used to be. I told her a few of the things he's done and she expressed concern and believes his behaviour is unacceptable, seems 'a little emotionally abusive' and that I should break up with him. But I cant help but think that she may be being a bit overvigilent considering my past.

So some of things that I told her about are; 
1. Lately if I ever bring up something thsts bothering me or I dont agree with how hes behaving towards me he either ignores me or will block my number for a while. Then when he unblocks me he will say it was my fault for irritating him.

2. On top of that, he will also accuse me of arguing. Which to me seems like a way of projecting back on to me and avoiding any responsibility. For example one night we had plans to do something, we had made them a week in advance. A few days before he started telling me how he was going to the pub. I reminded him we had plans, to which he reacted 'how am I meant to fucking remember'. Towhich I responded that I managed to and then he counters with 'oh after another argument are we. You just love to argue.' And it continues that way so I then feel like I can't stick to my guns or else I'm just a nag. And its become that way for a lot of things lately where if I express anything that he doesn't agree with, even if he begins a discussion about politics and I say something that opposes his views then it's me trying to start another 'argument.'. Its as though I can't have a opinion that differs or I cant question him. 

3. When we do argue he starts to swear, raise his voice and grits his teeth. Now I dont know if this is a new thing or if this is how he always argues because prior to this we never really argued (my friend says shes noticed that when I recall our arguments to her I now seem to stand my ground more whereas when I used to tell her about disagreements between him and I, I would always make excuses for him. She then said that it  concerns her because it's as though he has an issue with me being assertive. And that hea almost trying to gaslight me as by calling me 'argumentative' I start questioning whether I'm ok to be hurt by things he does 

4. Hes becoming mean over the silliest things. One example; he passed a test he needed to do recently and was really worried about. I went to the shop bought him a small congratulations gift and a card. While we were texting I told him and asked when I could drop them off (sidenote; I got his 3 or 4 times a week so it didnt seem intrusive to ask) in a message that included other chit chat. He messaged me back but made no recognition of me telling him I had a card and present. I later said 'yoo-hoo, 🎁?' which to me, wasn't rude, it fits in with how we often communicate. But He was offended, said he had seen it, he just answered that part because he wasnt sure when he would be back home yet. So to get ofc his case and stop trying for an argument. I then told him I wasnt and told him hes been saying that a lot lately and i dont understand why. He then told me to fuck off and to 'keep my fucking presents'

4. Because of the swearing, voice raising etc. And my previous abusive relationship (which I was diagnosed with CPTSD) Theres been times where I've had panic attacks after an argument. I sometimes freeze and can't say anything. Afterwards I usually cry. And this is the part that im I'm conflicted over.. he reacts by telling me I'm weird, that I need go grow up, that he needs a woman and not a child. On one hand I understand that it must be hard to deal with, my panic attacks aren't desirable and I dont want to bring previous baggage to my current relationship but it also seems a bit harsh. My friend says it's completely unacceptable. 

Could his behaviour seem in any way abusive? Obviously what I've said cant be the whole picture, I can only give some examples. I think my friend might be over reacting but at the same time it scares me to think I could be heading down the same road I have previously. 

Tldr"" boyfriend is acting a bit of a jerk, becoming more hostile and mean. Isnt letting me express opinions without shooting me down as 'argumentative'. My friend is calling him abusive and thinks he tries to gaslight me. I think she might be over protective as I was previously in a very abusive relationship",relationship_advice

So this has been stressing me out: I bought a nice watch for my boyfriend about a month ago. He's always wanted a watch and figured this year he should buy himself one. He's been sending me photos of the exact model (I'm a great girlfriend if I must say so myself and bought him that model) he wants. He's always adored watches, in fact we just had a phonecall where he performed an entire monologue about how badly he wants one.

&#x200B;

He's currently in the middle of his finals, extremely stressed out, we have a trip lined up in a week and I can't stop freaking out that he's going to get a watch on his own at this point. I also can't bring myself to focus on my own schoolwork since I'm trying to discreetly dissuade him from getting one, but to no avail lol. 

&#x200B;

Should I just give him the watch tomorrow after his first exam to perhaps motivate him for the rest of his tests? I also want to stop freaking out and worrying about it. Or should it be better to just wait 10 more days? He's German and I remember reading something about how they think its really bad luck, culturally, to open gifts before christmas which may or may not extend to regular gift giving. Would that matter?

I'd really appreciate your advice!

697,e6defn,Voluptuous_Salmon,1575528298.0,1,I’m not sure if I’m unhappy,"[F21] I have a boyfriend and at times things are great. I’m a very lovey dovey person that loves to cuddle and kiss but sometimes it feels like it’s a chore for him to make out and he only cuddles when he feels up for it. We’ve been together for almost two years and he is my best friend, but some days I just feel lost with this relationship. We’re both in college and started dating freshman year. He’s extremely honest to the point that it really hurts sometimes. He’s also extremely practical (he believes that buying flowers is stupid cause they just die and I don’t take proper care of them).  We’ve talked about our future together and getting married a lot and said I love you after our second date cause we instantly felt connected. I’ve had two other serious relationships before but we never were this serious when it came to marriage and it slightly freaks me out how it’s no longer in the distant future. I feel like a jerk and stupid to question my relationship, but sometimes I just want someone that will go out of their way to do something small that may not be practical just cause he knows that I love it. He does a lot of things for me, like spends almost everyday with me (even though he never lets me forget that we spend too much time together). He’s helped me move and helped me study and for the most part is there when I need him. I just am unsure if our personalities match. I’m a homebody that likes to stay in and cuddle and he gets massive FOMO whenever he doesn’t go to a party. He wants to fly for the marines after college and then be a pilot, but I’ve never seen myself as being with someone that isn’t home every night and there for all the special holidays. I question our relationship sometimes, but whenever we are in a fight I’m terrified that he’ll break up with me cause I can’t picture my life without him. I know this is all stupid and maybe I just wanted to vent, but I would really appreciate some advice on the matter.

We both are progressing towards being in a relationship, but we are taking things slow and still trying to get comfortable with one another.

I see him again in two weeks for Christmas, and am curious to know if anyone has any advice for what I can do to not feel so awkward about expressing my feelings towards him, and how I can be more open with just being myself.

He also uses an app to price match to get discounts on things in every store we go into. (It's a little embarrassing). He also seems to go into panic mode about every little thing and works himself 24-7 and choose to never sit down and relax at home. 
He has been traumatized from supposedly being homeless (I asked his parents about this and they told me he has never been homeless.) which is why he's so frugal about money and tries to not step on people's toes often.
It's gotten pretty annoying that he counts calories of everything we go out to eat. He'll bring up how many calories are in things and will make a big deal about my eating habits because I like sweets and I usually want to buy some to snack on whenever I study but he goes into a lecture of how sugar will kill my pancreas and how many calories are in things.
But to be honest the biggest thing that bugs me is how he gets upset whenever he has to pay for things due to the fact that I come from a low-income family, I'm in college and whatever money I get is used for things like school supplies and other things.  He goes into a whole spiel about how we're in a provider relationship because he's doing the providing and I've asked him multiple times that he doesn't need to pay for me and that we don't need to go out to eat or do things because it's unnecessary. The thing is that he spends his money on his cars and then squirrels the rest of it away.
I am unsure of what to do since I do not want to be rude and tell him to chill out about worrying so much over every little thing.  Any advice or insight on this whole ""provider relationship"" (A term that I've never ever heard of) is.

Edit: I forgot to mention that he has the belief that if something bad has happened to someone in his family that it'll happen to other people. one example is one of his relatives getting a college degree in photojournalism and not being able to do much with it. So his relative ended up being on welfare (As he calls it I forgot the proper term) and wasted his life watching TV and playing video games. (this is something my boyfriend seems to hate the most as he doesn't watch TV often and despises video games to the point he'll pout and make snide comments if anyone else plays games.) I've had to tell him more than once that he shouldn't base experiences of things he has seen other people in his family do on others.",relationship_advice

706,e6d691,funkmetalalchemist,1575526910.0,1,My (25f) gf’s (24f) parents wont let her come to my family’s Christmas,"Backstory that may make this easier to understand:

-My gf and I started our relationship long distance 4 years ago, at a distance of over 2000 miles away. Last summer, we moved in together in my home state and this summer we moved to my gf’s home state. 

-gf’s parents are extremely wealthy

-gf’s parents only recently started liking me. We suspect there is some lingering homophobia from mom - not serious, but just discomfort/disbelief

-Before we moved in together, before we knew where we’d end up, we agreed that wherever we would move, we would go to the opposite location for Christmas/other extended holidays, as we are both close with our families.

Last year, even though it was difficult, given that we were living in my home state, we went to my gf’s home state for Christmas, for nearly two weeks. My parents and siblings were understandably upset to not have me there for the first time, but they know that my gf and I are serious, with engagement/marriage very much imminent. They were also aware of the deal my gf and I had made before moving about going opposite for Christmas.

Well, this year we moved to gf’s home state. Her mother can be a little stubborn and abrasive so we knew that she would not take it well when we told her that gf wouldn’t be attending for Christmas.
Boy, what an understatement.

I was not in attendance for the dinner where gf broke the news (gf told me it would probably be easier on her mom if I weren’t there), but according to gf, her mom flipped. Started crying, saying it’s not fair, saying she couldn’t go, that my family was big and hers was small so they needed us there more, and that we aren’t even married, so why are we even doing this anyway. She offered my gf money to not go (worth saying they are much more moneyed than my parents, who would not be able to afford buying me a plane ticket. Gf’s parents bought us both tickets to visit them last Christmas), and she also tried to barter thanksgiving for Christmas (weeks after I had already bought my thanksgiving plane ticket). Refused to give it up. 

After dinner eventually ended, gf came home incredibly upset (obviously). Saying she was at an impasse, didn’t know what to do. She knew it would be unfair to me and my family to skip out on ours, but also knew how upset her mom was. My family absolutely adores her, and she didn’t want to upset my mom, who was so excited about having her, and she didn’t want to upset her own mom, who was clearly going through something (first child “gone from the nest” can be hard, I know). I hated seeing her so upset so after maybe 1-2 hours of tears and discussions I finally gave in. Said, fine, go to your mom’s for Christmas, but please fly out on the 26th so we can celebrate with you.

I regret giving in so much because now her mom is clearly aware that she has power over us. She bought gf a car literally 2 weeks after this convo for her birthday and I can’t help connecting the two. And gf just told me her parents bought her tickets - departing on the 28th, not the 26th.

Last year, we promised each other we weren’t going to have to spend a Christmas apart again. This year, we will be because of MIL’s refusal to accept that her daughter is growing up. My mother is devastated and now has no desire to meet gf’s mom, nor do a few other members of my family.

I’ve worked SO hard to gain the approval of my in laws, and just when I get it, they do something like this and my love and trust for them is so hurt and damaged. I do not want my MIL to continue controlling and manipulating her daughter and I for the rest of our lives, and I also want to be able to maintain a relationship with her family. 

TL;DR: future mother in law manipulated gf and pushed us to break our long-standing promise to each other about christmas travel plans. Don’t know how to handle holidays/future interactions with this woman.",relationship_advice

Basically my boyfriend gets up in the morning for work, about 30 mins before me and watches porn in the other room. He does this every single day. I am literally laying there and would have sex if he made it clear he wanted it. Some times I try and he still gets up and goes in the other roo.!

I've not bought it up with him yet but I know 100% he does it. I'm pretty sure he would deny it but at this point I just need to know if I am being irrational. As far as I am aware, this hasn't happened in my past relationships and I find it a little odd. I am laying there in bed, I would have sex with him yet he would rather get up and watch porn?

I get masturbation, everyone does it, a lot of people watch porn etc and I get not everyone wants to have sex every single day, but at least wait until I am not around. We have sex once a week, if that. I've bought it up before that I'd like to have sex more, I've said we can go buy some toys, whatever he wants, he just isn't interested. He has to be drunk before we have sex also. And it is only on the weekends, when he can't really watch porn because I am around. I don't get it. I am not the most attractive but I know I'm not ugly. Is he just lazy? Is he really that disinterested in me? I am struggling not to let it make me feel insecure.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 17 months now. For the past couple months or so I have been having small arguments with my girlfriend every so often. I know “fighting” is healthy for a relationship, leads to building stronger connections and such, but we have been having increasingly more arguments. At this point they happen maybe 1-2 times a week now. We’ve been able to patch them up pretty well each and every time but recently we have had 2 big arguments that haven’t been sitting well. 

For the most part our fights are usually brought up from either one of two things. Either me doing something stupid on accident and not thinking like a normal person, or her overreacting about something small. Both issues have been addressed by us but we keep making mistakes and causing fights. Usually I am the one responsible for them and I beat myself up over them because I honestly don’t mean to hurt my girlfriends feelings, I just make dumb mistakes often and this has lead to her being untrustworthy of me. Right now we have been working ourselves out of another big fight but things are very *uncomfortable* for us at the moment. I love her so much and I want to get us back on a stable track, but at the same time I’m afraid that these mistakes will keep happening and our relationship will fall because of it. 

Decided to come here for any advice at all because I wanted some other opinions on the matter. I’m open to anything right now.",relationship_advice

711,e6d4y0,exotic_chick,1575526701.0,1,"toxic ex-best friend manipulated me for years, tried to sabotage my relationship on several occasions, and is stuck in my life. Help pls:(","Hi reddit. My boyfriend’s best friend’s girlfriend (I’ll call her X) was my best friend for years until she tried to sabotage my relationship with my boyfriend. 

I call X my best friend, when in reality she was just my closest friend, but never my best friend. I could never trust her with secrets, she always gave me advice to try and sabotage me, she was SO JEALOUS of me. She would steal my clothes, my makeup, jewelry, shoes, and deny it when I would catch her. When we went out to eat, she would order the same meal as me and would watch me as I ate and would only eat the same amount as I did. She was a pathological liar and would give me backhanded compliments all the time. This went on for about four years. This relationship affected my ability to make friends since I had such terrible trust issues and boundaries due to X’s behavior. 

A couple months before I ended our friendship, I started dating a guy who was best friends with X’s boyfriend. Almost immediately, she would call me every day saying things like “don’t come crying to me when he cheats on you” “he’s a scumbag why are you with him” “you are way too good for him”, saying anything she could to convince me to leave him. 

One day while I was on vacation with my boyfriend, he surprised me with a pair of designer sunglasses. I posted the sunglasses on my social media, and X immediately called me and said “that’s what he gives to all the girls he’s f*ck*ng, don’t feel special. You’re not special to him.” And then she immediately called my boyfriend and said “I hope you know that exoctic_chick is only with you for your money. I know because she told me.” (NEVER SAID THAT IN MY LIFE). 

For weeks, she would continue to call and text my boyfriend and tell him lies about me and why I was with him. It started to affect my relationship with my boyfriend because he started to question what she was saying. He has had trust issues in the past related to him having money, so for X to say that I was only with him for money really hurt him. I finally had enough and confronted her. She denied everything she said about me, even though I had physical proof she said those things. So I ended the friendship for good. 

I haven’t spoken to her in almost two years now but she has tried to keep in touch with my boyfriend, saying she “misses him” and will send him funny posts every once and a while. 

My problem is, our boyfriend’s have been friends for almost 15 years now, and are practically brothers. Our feud has affected their relationship too and has caused a huge strain, something that I never wanted for their friend ship. Our boyfriends are also planning on going into business together. X and her boyfriend will most likely get married, and my boyfriend and I are engaged. I’ve explained a thousand times over and over to my boyfriend why X is crazy and manipulative and how she has hurt me in the past, and he won’t see my side of it. He denies it saying she is a “good friend to him” :|   I would never make him choose between me and his best friend, but I cannot have her in my life forever. So reddit, how do I handle this? Do I just forgive and forget, even though she might to try and sabotage my relationship again? There’s no reasoning with my boyfriend and he will never seen my side.

When I first met her up until last January, I was dating a guy who wasnt right for me and I ultimately gained the courage to break up with him.  I've known that I was bisexual since I was in middle school and it was fun to also have her as a bisexual friend who understood how I felt.  

She made it clear while I was with my boyfriend that she was attracted to me and I was attracted to her.  In about March, I brought up being in a friends with benefits situation with her and she ended up agreeing and we had a lot of fun for about a month.  Throughout this time, I was afraid that this would ruin our friendship but I loved being so close to her physically and emotionally that I stopped being afraid for a bit.  She then asked me to be her girlfriend and I really wanted to say yes but I was afraid.  

I remembered that my ex -boyfriend was such a good friend of mine, we laughed and hung out all the time before and during the time we were together and now I dont keep in contact with him because it ended so badly.  But she helped me so much during the pain of this breakup, my feelings for her grew because she was so kind and caring.  When she asked me out she even made it clear that she really liked me and was not trying to ""take advantage of my vulnerability from the breakup."" But the distance from my former friend turned boyfriend turned stranger hurt so bad, I didnt want this to happen with her so I said no in an effort to save our friendship. She then went to study abroad in Germany and when she came back she brought up that she did not want to continue with our FWB relationship because she didnt want to jeopardize our friendship and I agreed and brought up my fears that maybe it could turn sour based on my last relationship.  We've been hanging out a lot as friends since then and she often drives me to my therapist appointments.  But recently as we've been in a class together, seeing each other more often, my feelings for her have grown and I dont know what to do about it.  Shes really cute and I find myself staring and feeling really silly, so it's becoming a bit more obvious.  I'm afraid that maybe I lost my chance or even if I do tell her and the feelings are mutual, I may become afraid of jeopardixing our friendship again, panic, and regret saying anything.  Should I tell her, or will this just ruin our friendship?  Should I not and pretend I feel nothing?",relationship_advice

715,e6d1gi,throw193away,1575526127.0,0,Am I (20F) sex obsessed or does my boyfriend (21M) just have really low sex drive? Need advice on how to make our relationship and sex better.,"This is a throwaway, because I'm embarrassed. I'm not a native English speaker so I'm sorry for my language. 

I need outside perspective and guidance for our relationship and sex in it. It doesn't feel appropriate to ask my or his parents so this is my best shot. I really want opinions on whether our relationship is something that we can still make work, because outside of sex, it is perfect. I want to know if its okay that I feel this way. I know others have it worse and I'm sorry if I come across as entitled. I'm also sorry that this is all over the place, its 7 am and I didn't sleep all night, because I've been crying. He came up with the idea to put it on reddit and ask. 

I am 20F and I've been with my boyfriend 21M for a few years now. We moved together really quickly into the relationship as my family was abusive for years and I really wanted out. We have been living together for about a year now, we have arguments about once a month, what we thought was normal until we both recently discovered that they all are about the same thing, which is sex.

He gets really anxious about sex, because he is afraid of disappointing me to the extent of completely not having it. I've told him countless times and have tried to ensure that it's okay, that I just want to feel intimate and close to him, but he still feels very anxious about it. I understand that anxiety isn't something that is fixed by me saying it'll be fine, but I don't know how to make him feel like it's ok. Sometimes it just feels like I have to go out of my way to get him to have sex with me that it feels wrong and thus we just don't have it at all. We didn't do anything for a month, and in that time we both felt so lifeless and empty, which means he wants and needs it too. We were both so unhappy, that after a month he actually initiated it, which was so nice that it made me cry. 

I feel so selfish and needy writing this, but I really feel like I need him to touch me and be intimate with me. I daydream about us having ""normal"" sex and I cry while thinking about him wanting or needing me, because that's all I want. I put normal in quations marks, because I don't know what to call it or how to describe it. I'm so embarrassed by it, but it's all I get so I usually just shut up and enjoy it. He always eats me out while I watch porn on my phone until I feel good, after which he puts a condom on and finishes. I always watch porn on my phone and I hate myself for it, but it feels like its practically impossible to feel good just laying there and staring at the ceiling. It takes so much mental power to try to think of him sexually, because he never shows himself in that way, although I do try. It's not like I'm not attracted to him, because I am. I always imagine it's us in porn and not some random people, which makes it even more sad. He doesn't mind me watching it at all, he actually says to ""go on my phone"", while he is down there. He says he used to mind it, but now doesn't, because he just wants to make me feel good and happy. I feel so lucky to have found a man who wants to make me feel good and I feel so entitled, because I don't feel like it's good enough. I know I should just be happy with it, because he does his best trying to feel sexual for me and make me feel good. I feel so bad, because I sometimes feel like I'm forcing him to have sex with me and I told him that. He got kind of angry and said I can't make him do that and it's him doing it, because he wants to do so. 

Maybe it's just me that is obsessed with sex, but I really really hope it's not that. We have sex about 2-3 times a week, but all of it is initiated by me. If I didn't initiate, we would have it once every month or every few months. I used to blame myself so much for wanting sex, I hated it, to the extent on wanting to hurt myself. I used to say to myself that sex is so unnecessary and relationships don't need it and that I'm so disgusting for asking for it. I was willing to take medication to try to lower my need so we wouldn't have to have it at all and everything would be great. He didn't let me and said he will try to feel more sexual, so we kind of met in the middle with what we have now. Since me repressing my emotions didn't work at all, I asked him if I could have sex with other people, and he said no. I respect that, so I just left it like that. It makes me so depressed knowing that if I just could erase these feelings, everything would be perfect. I hate myself so much.

We have tried to find a reason other than just low sex drive. It's not like he isn't getting it from somewhere else, he doesn't even masturbate. He isn't gay, he hasn't been traumatised, and he keeps insisting it isn't me. He just really does have a low sex drive. We are both diagnosed with depression, so that probably plays a role in it. I try so hard to make him feel sexual, and it works most of the time, but just ends up the same boring way. I offer him a blowjob every few days to try to get him to get excited, but he always refuses it. He says he feels guilty that my jaw hurts afterwards, but it should be fine if it's just a little bit. I get so put off by this, because in the past few years, he has let me do it fewer than 10 times, 8 of the times being while he is eating me out. 

We are rarely affectionate, a kiss once or twice a week and a hug like almost every day. I sleep in his arms almost every day. He wants more affection and I always try to give him more and more every day, but it's really hard, because it feels like I'm kissing a friend, not a boyfriend. He explained to me that he feels love through affection, and I told him that I feel love from intimacy and being close. So either one us sucks it up and does it what the other one needs to feel love and then they get to feel love too. We have both confessed that we don't love each other as much as a few years ago. 

I cry myself asleep multiple times a week, thinking about how this is how our relationship will always be, until we die. We have so much fun during the day and we are so inseparable, we do everything together and enjoy it a lot. But then it's time to go to bed and we both dread it, because  I don't want to have to work so much at trying to get him to feel something sexual, to just have him under the blanket and me on my phone. He dreads it, because he wants to make me feel good, but he is anxious about failing and disappointing me. He works himself up and feels really bad. Then we just don't have sex and we both feel really bad, because to some extent he wants it too. 

I really want to be with him, and I think we have something special. We love each other so much and all our hobbies and interests work together perfectly. We have discussed about future life together so many times and we both want the same things, with each other. So please, tell me your opinions and ask me anything, I'll try to answer the best I can. How can we make this work?",relationship_advice
716,e6d1fc,uranaru,1575526123.0,1,Trash talked my gf’s (22F) gift to me (22M) without realizing. What to do?,"Hi everyone, so my girlfriend and I have been dating for 1.5 years and have been doing long distance for around half of it. This will be our second Christmas together and I really wanted to make it special. That being said, I ordered her some nice gifts and she did the same for me. 

She ordered my gift shipped directly to me, with the idea that we’d open gifts together. She’s the type to try and figure out a surprise before it’s sprung, so she kept asking me questions about what I got her, and she volunteered some info about what she got me, too. She told me it was useful, and the contents of the box would be plainly visible. 

I was wondering if it arrived, so I checked the mail room and looked around for any boxes matching that description. I saw a coffee machine (a keurig) and a mixer, neither of which were addressed to me, and once we got to talking earlier, I told her what I found. 
I told her that I saw a keurig machine, and how I wouldn’t buy one because they use disposable cups, and how they suck, blah blah. overall I must’ve sounded like a douche cause I’ve never owned one. 

She told me mine would be coming in the mail tomorrow. We both laughed, until I realized that she wasn’t joking, and that was my gift. It finally sunk in that I was a tremendous jackass and had been terribly ungrateful. 

I should say that I do in fact need a coffee machine, I need convenience, but I decided to shit all over keurigs for some reason. Needless to say, she’s crushed. All that thought went into this gift, and she definitely knows I don’t like it (or at least I said so.) I’ve tried to explain myself and apologized many, many times, but I don’t think I can solve this problem with words. 

How should I handle this? Can I do anything to rectify the situation? Should I just return it, give it back to her or keep it and give it a shot? 
I definitely do not deserve it after all I’ve put her through. Ive already spilled my guts to her about it.  definitely helps that we’re seeing each other in a few days, but this isn’t ideal to say the least.

So I told him to go outside to calm down and tried to force him outside. We both fell and he kicked me in my face resulting in a horrible bloody mess. He then picked up his phone and called 911 on himself. The cops came immediately and arrested him in the front lawn. They took photos of my face and I didn’t press charges. The police told me the DA most likely will though. 

I have not received a phone call from him nor any attorneys or law enforcement. He hasn’t contacted anyone in his family. I called the only bail bonds in town and they hadn’t heard from him either. So they made some calls for me and told me that his bond is $7,500. I call the sheriff and he’s being charged with a class A misdemeanor assault causing bodily harm to a family member. 

He’s never been arrested or in trouble with the law and neither have I. We’ve been together for 7 years and things just barely started getting violent.

They will not stop ripping ass. Every time I come back to my room it smells like dog shit covered in a can of Hawaiian febreze. 

This morning I woke up incredibly early choking on the stench of their farts. I was literally awoken by the terrible smell. 

When this first started happening I thought maybe they'd just eaten something weird. But it's been this way for weeks. It's like psychological torture, trying to sit there and avoid breathing out of my nose most of the time. I keep my window open and fan on even though I'm freezing, covered in blankets in a futile attempt for fresh air. 

I don't know what else to do besides sit here and suffer. To their credit, they clearly know they have a problem and try to cover up the smell. But nothing is helping. I don't know what to do.

Do I bring it up to them?? It's been this way for literal weeks. I know they can't help being gassy but I am not exaggerating when I say it's hardly bearable. Does anyone have any ideas on how to make it smell less awful???",relationship_advice

We did not discuss what it was, but actions speak louder than words. We had sex and he basically wanted no conversations. I thought that was just how he was. 

Months pass and unknown to me he gets a girlfriend. One he meets friends, introduces her to his friends, goes hiking and camping together, visits her at college, spends some weekends with her and playing board games. To me that tells me he valued her a lot more than me. It made me question my self worth when I found out all of this. He met her after, was so strict and controlling with me, and did not get to know me. This led me to comparing our looks and my actions. 

When I found out he was in an exclusive, committed relationship for a year, I confronted him and he blocked me. To me this seemed like he was investing in her and actually liked and cared about her. I was just some meaningless fun on the side who he would exploit and use when he was bored and wanted to get his dick wet. I was some nothing he did not care about. 

I told her and she blocked and harassed me. This made me mad at her too. I was so hurt and she couldn’t even listen or see my side. For months she then harassed me for details of his relationship when me when I wanted to move on. Not once did she thank me or say sorry for her actions towards me. This made me feel worse about myself because I then felt I was beat out or valued less than a person who is not nice and kind of pathetic and stupid. I guess I was jealous she was valued and respected more. The most annoying part was I don’t know or can’t see why. 

I hated both him and her for what he did to me. Was my analysis on the situation correct? Are my feelings just? Why did I feel this way? Can someone tell me where I went wrong or why she was valued more?

So it’s the typical story, the bad boy AKA the mean one and the good guy AKA the sweet one. I’ll call the bad boy for Elijah and the good guy for James.

Ok so I’ve been struggling with this for a few months, the thing is Elijah shares the same personality as me minus the bad behavior, but James is sweet and we hold hands and cuddle with our legs. But when we play a game called pig they always try to save me from getting a letter (like P I G) and I feel so special. But one of my best friends likes Elijah, but I rlly don’t like guys who’s mean and stuff, so I kinda stick with James the most. Mostly because were also buddy’s in a project, but I know they like me because 1. They both only try to save me 2. I can cuddle with James 3. Elijah constantly push me onto the bed or wall (I forgot to say he is a little flirty) when I’m over at his house.

So what should I do? Like honestly this is a mess but my other best friend encourage me to go to her Ex (James) because her best friend (the one who likes Elijah) wants to be with Elijah.

[Update] I came over at Jame’s house and we chit chatted about stuff and watched a movie. Then i has a urge to ask him if he likes me and I just blurted it out, he was shocked he said that I also like him. We watched the movie while holding hands, but he had to go after the movie... but we hold hands while going to the bus stop to drive to his soccer practice.
Yes I am with James now. And I love him.

I’m still shook about it and I know I shouldn’t be super surprised...but it’s 2019 and here I am.,"I guess I am just in need of a little advice on where to go from here. I am an African-American girl who is from the south. I have had some small experiences of course with racism, but none that have made me feel as terrible as this experience has. 

I am currently going to school in the midwest and back in the spring I met a really nice boy. Funny and he thought I was funny, which is even better. We clicked really well and quickly became almost attached at the hip. After a couple of really exciting months he told me that he was going to tell his parents about me and that his mother always asks him about girls, so she was probably going to be very excited. Well, she wasn’t and neither was his dad when he told them the sport I played at our school and they looked me up on the roster. They were the exact opposite of excited in fact and he even said that his mother looked pale in the face. Then, like I mentioned earlier, they told him he was absolutely not allowed to date me and that they would take away everything right from under him if he did. 

From that point on things changed. He changed and after a few days of shared tears he finally told me that he thought it would be best if we just be friends. That was it, no fighting for what he thought was right. Nothing. His parents pay for his college, help him with rent and have been with him his entire life. Their whole family is very close-knit and all live around the same area. His family comes first and I understand that. 

We stayed friends and I dealt with many more months of reliving the horrific fact that in his family’s eyes, I was not good enough. Not for any reason other than my skin color. Something I can’t change. I had hope in my heart that they would change their minds, want to meet me and see that I love their son as much as they do and that I am a good person. Of course, that never happened and time after time I had to hear remarks about me or about how he should, “find himself a nice mixed girl.” Unfortunately that’s not even the worst of what I’ve heard from his supposedly Christian (but hateful and snooty and racist) parents. Regardless of that and regardless of the hurt, I am tired of letting this affect my day, my emotions and my energy like it does. 

Part of me wants to continue to be friends because we are so close and it’s comfortable,  but the other part of me feels like I deserve more than someone who wouldn’t stand up for me, didn’t choose me and who couldn’t even stand up for himself or what he believes in. Most of me thinks that I would just be better off without this friendship in my life. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. Any advice?

Tl;dr 
Caucasian guy I was dating and I found out that his parents were racist. They forbid him from seeing me because I was African-American and threatened to take away everything from him, which for him meant help with rent, tuition and more. His family members are all really close and he just couldn’t see himself being without him so he chose them over me. We decided to be friends, but it just hasn’t been the same and I struggle with whether I want to be friends with someone won’t stand up for me, stand up for himself, what he believes in or someone who easily chose others over me.

Everything fell apart and she had an emotional meltdown, packed her things and left that night. A 2.5 year relationship disintegrated in front of me in less than two hours","**Inb4:** Our age difference is definitely a factor in this story. Please don't just trot out the ""[Half age +7 there's your problem Boom!](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201405/who-is-too-young-or-too-old-you-date)"" response, as that isn't helpful. However, open and thoughtful responses as to how/why our age difference was a factor are welcome. Story will also include appearances by the three thieves of relationships: lack of communication, insecurity and jealousy.

There's a lot of backstory/moving parts here, please bear with me.

My ex(?), Denise and I started talking online a little less than three years ago, when she was 18. Denise posted about being into older guys and we started chatting. Everything just clicked. We'd chat for hours, finish each other's sentences, etc. Our first date was also the first time that we met each other. It was better in person than we imagined and we've been together ever since. This is probably important, but I'm her first love. She's dated a LOT before me, but I'm the first person she's been in love with.

We did everything together and it felt amazing. There wasn't one thing that we didn't love about each other. Nothing that we disliked, no annoyances. Nothing. Our families loved each of us, despite the early questions of ""*How* old is s/he?"" Her dad is retired special forces and still a tough SOB. Even he was supportive of our relationship after meeting and seeing how we felt about each other.

Denise had a rough childhood. Spent a year in a bad foster care situation. She's the youngest in a large family and sibling fights were typically settled with physical aggression. Being in a family with three generations of military men also meant that she had to grow up and toughen up fast. She's in her last semester at college and will most likely get hired right out of school for the line of work that she wants to do.

I have a young son from a previous relationship. My son's mother, Jackie, and Denise get along relatively well (I thought). They hang out sometimes, go clothes shopping for my son. Jackie started dating someone new after Denise and I started dating. Jackie became pregnant, got engaged and they're now planning their wedding.

Denise is great with my son. The two of them love each other and it makes me happy to see the two of them get along so well. Her school schedule at this point is relatively light and she's here at my place a lot of the time. She prides herself on cleaning (even worked as a cleaner for a while), and the place is always in great shape when I get home from work. I'm not a slob, but I'm also not the cleanest person in the world, either. Every single time I come home I am VERY thankful for all of the work that she's done. I'm also quick to say that I'd never expect her to put in this much work by herself and if she would have waited we could have cleaned up together. I surprise her with flowers every month or two, and do a lot of other small, sweet things for her, in part as thanks for everything that she does here for the three of us.

The past few months she's been complaining about feeling stressed and anxious. Her body is tense and sore from it, She feels nauseous. I suggest that she go to the doctor and offer to talk and ask her what she's so worried about. The answer's always vague, about school or things in her family, or work.

We've been talking about marriage and starting a family for at least a year. We've talked about moving in together, about getting engaged and continuing to move forward with our lives together. But for some reason or another, the moving in part never came to be. I don't know why I had a one-track mind of The Order of things, and never thought ""You know, I could propose and we could be engaged before we move in together""

A few weeks ago I started thinking that I'm getting to be an age where I'm not sure if I want to have kids. I wasn't a hard 'No' in my mind, but I wasn't as eager as I'd felt in the past. It was on my mind, and Denise could tell that something was up. We sat down to talk and I told her my feeling. She told me that she doesn't consider me old at all and that she only wants two things in life - the first is to marry me, which I agreed to before she was even finished speaking. Then she said that she also wants to have a child with me. I said that I know that we had talked about that a lot, but that right now I'm not as much of a yes as I had been.

And that answer triggered just an incredible outpouring of emotion. It came from out of nowhere. We were both holding each other and she was so upset. To me my answer wasn't a ""no"" but meant to be a start of a conversation about, ""Ok, what's our timeline for these things and let's start moving"". Instead it sparked uncontrollable crying and sobbing and she could barely breathe. It was like a dam broke and everything was pouring out at once. She said that anything but a hard 'yes' came across as a 'no' to her. She just jumped up and said, ""I can never be the woman you want me to be. I've gotta get out of here. I've got to find someone new now and start all over"" She ran to the bedroom and started packing her stuff. I followed her and asked what was going on and it was like I wasn't even there. She was babbling to herself and I couldn't understand what she was saying, it was so out of control and out of character.

As she was packing she calmed down enough to talk, but only in short bursts. She said that she feels like she needs to be The Perfect Housewife for me and the stress and anxiety that she puts on herself to keep the house clean is unbearable. She's on BC but is terrified that if she accidentally got pregnant I'd leave her because in my first relationship the pregnancy caused its downfall (more of a trigger for the inevitable, but this definitely wasn't the time to bring that up)... that even though she knows it's completely illogical she's jealous af of my ex because we've been dating longer but she gets to have a(nother) baby first and got engaged and is going to get married first... She said that she's had so much stress and anxiety that she's been having other physical feminine symptoms and had to go to her doctor because of it.

There were a few other things along the same lines, but I just stood there feeling like I'd been hit in the head with a two by four! We'd never talked about ANY of those things before! And I would be supportive of her on all of them. I thought that I was appreciative of all of the work that she does around here while verbalizing as best I could that I never expected her to do much work. It was like she had an idealized version of love and that's what she was trying to act out. Of course I'd never abandon her if she ever became pregnant.

There were other things that she said caused her to feel insecure and self-conscious - but they were all things that *SHE* brings up because she thought that *I* liked them! If I knew that anything in our relationship was making her feel bad about herself I would have wanted us to stop that immediately! That's not any kind of relationship that anyone wants to be in!

Denise finished packing, said she needed space and left. And I was left standing there in complete, utter shock. Since she wanted space I was good about that, but a lot of her things were still here. I packed them up and a few days later told her that I'd drop them off. She said no, I shouldn't have to do that, and she came by to get the rest of her things. When Denise got here she said that just being here was driving her stress into overdrive. She was afraid that I was going to scream at her, or hit her because of what happened (?!?! I am not a violent person at all. I've never hit ANYONE in my life and I've never even so much as raised my voice at her).

We cried again in each other's arms and said how horrible we felt. Neither one of us had slept, our bodies hurt, I'd been throwing up and missed work because of it. We told each other that we loved each other and I tried to kiss her. It was like kissing a dead fish. She said that she'd message me probably in a few weeks and left. It seemed to be on a good vibe and despite the tears we were both smiling.

A few days later we started texting for a short while and it was just a very light ""hey, how are you feeling?"" conversation. Nothing deep at all. Again, I backed off because I knew that she wanted space. Two days later Denise texted me, essentially saying ""I know that I said I needed space but I also need texting space. When I hear from you it sets my stress and anxiety into overdrive. Please don't respond, I'll message you when we can talk about things again.""

And that was it. No timeline of when she'd check in, nothing. After a day or two it started to eat at me like maggots devouring my insides. I wanted to go to her house, I wanted to talk and find out all these things that were bothering her. I wanted to fix all of these things that felt like they would have all been a 2 minute conversation. I agreed with everything that she'd spat out at me the night when it all crumbled down! She'd just never brought any of them up (for fear of upsetting me?)

Flash forward and I'm sitting in my therapist's office trying to piece together all that had happened. Near the end he flipped through his notepad and said, ""Even though I don't know Denise at all, from the things that you've said, and her upbringing, I wrote the word 'security' down three different times."" He suggested that I wait a few more days, then maybe send some flowers with a gentle ""I'm here for you"" note. He was emphatic about ""no riding in on horseback with 5 dozen roses"", but something small would be a good symbol.

I told him that I was a bit wary about that because of, coincidentally, something which I think that I read on this sub: What makes my desire to get back together with her more important than her desire to have space right now? He said that he understood that, but at the same time humans are horrible at treading water. She didn't say when she'd get back to me, so am I supposed to just wait around.... indefinitely?

So, a week and a half after she texted me that she wanted space, I sent a small bouquet of pink flowers with a note that I was still here for her. No response.

And that kicked my brain into overdrive. Ugh. This past Saturday I sent her an email. I said that I didn't want to be intrusive but wanted to give her new information. That I was on her side for all of the things that she'd mentioned that night that are causing her stress. That I loved her and that I still want to marry her. I thought long and hard and I DO want to raise a family with her. At the end I asked her to please reach out so we can talk about all of this because I can't tread water like this forever.

Objectively I'm sure that I need to sit back and give her space, but for how long until I just decide to cut my losses? Should I wait it out for a period and maybe ask her to go for a coffee? What do you think my next steps, or non-steps should be here?

g: don't focus on it u know she's not talking abt u ( or smn along those lines)

me: yeah so and so is doing such and such according to you

That ""according to you"" is the thing that happened. I said that and she acted as though I don't trust her. I apologised on the spot and she said she needed a few days.

3 days later here we are and that is where the second f- up occurs. I send her ∞ apologies. I send her so many that she asks one of my ex-friends to tell me to stop. (gatorade didn't tell me to stop) I royally f-ed up.

744,e6cqd9,Bombilillion,1575524370.0,7,How do I stop being the outsider and the extra guy outside other people's circles?,"I've always been that extra person and been bad at making social relations just because I'm incapable of really connecting to people. In most cases in I've actually just been the quiet extra guy in class that nobody really knows. Recently I've become much better at this and in my new studies I am able to have casual conversations with almost anyone in my class. This has been an amazing change for me and I'm so happy I was able to break that first shell on my own (even though it took three years), but now I want more.

I want to get on a level with people that they might take initiative sometimes to do stuff, hang out, eat or whatever. I don't want any more acquaintances. I want friends. I want some of my acquaintances to become my friends. We've more or less ""known"" eachother for 1+ years now but that's it.

But there is an additional challenge in this: I'm a cripple. 
My arms are more in the way than actually useful most of the time. I experience a great amount of physical pain every day and that only increases for every action my hands or arms perform. Normally I would have played sports with them, goofed around outside our invited them to dinner and ALWAYS helped out of they where the ones to invite, but ever since two years ago that has been extremely difficult for me. 

So what can I do? How do I get closer to people I already know and have seemingly good relations with? I don't think anyone mind my company so I doubt I would cause any drama, but I also don't really have any idea what I'm doing and I don't want to force myself into an already established circle of friends. But how else can I get my own circle of friends at this stage? Apart from acquaintances I have one best friend who is completely outside all of this. You can all most likely see my predicament quite clearly by now.

I love him dearly and he is really my best friend and the last thing I want to do with this post is make him out to be a problem. 

However I'm really concerned about our future. 

I have tried to bring up multiple times where he sees the relationship going and his last answer was ""well we'll probably just end up getting married."" 

I feel like maybe he is just settling for this relationship because we've already been together for a while and this is just ""good enough."" 

He works from a different state during the week so I only see him on weekends. 

The past few months I have felt extremely ignored, he would prioritize his friends or gaming over me, not for part of the weekend but the entire weekend. 

I have given up three different hobbies because it interfered with the small bit of time we get to spend together and I don't feel that he puts in the same effort. 

There are several other concerns as well like what is expected of me around the house, moving away if we were to purchase a home and other stuff. 

It's just feeling more and more like we're roommates instead of dating. And now there's just a weird distance that no one wants to bring up. 

I'm scared that this may be the end, but I'm also feeling really frustrated. Has anyone salvaged a relationship that was fading? How did you do it? How can I bring this up gently and without being whiny or accusing?

746,e6comb,ThrowRAthisisdumb,1575524104.0,2,"Girlfriend has broken trust many times, but wants to keep the friend she lied about. (All of us early 20s)","

Alright, this may be long and I’m going to try not to leave anything out. My girlfriend and I are meeting up today and will hopefully through these together later today or some other day. 

Alright, so for the past few years my girlfriend “Bleepblop” has been on a sports team with a guy “Jeff”. Her and Jeff were basically acquaintances until early this year. They began texting a lot. Literally every day to be exact. I didn’t really have a problem with this because I trusted her. Jeff never spoke to me which was weird, but i t became clear very quickly that Jeff has feelings for my bleepblop. 

I mentioned to her in a little teasy way that Jeff liked her, and she laughed but then denied that he did. She is a very kinda and trusting person so she didn’t want to believe that. We sat down and talked about it and I just said to make sure you set some boundaries with this dude and that he respects that you’re in a relationship. (She would go on to not do this.)

Rewind to the beginning of our relationship she was always a little mean to me when I’d go to her (sport) meets due to stress, but we talked about it and she improved a ton and was handling stress much better. Back to now she began to fall back into being rude. I’d try to talk to her and she’d barely speak to me or even look at me. She’d laugh and be fine talking to anyone else(not just Jeff). She even made me stop going out to eat with everyone after meets. I can’t say that all this is because of Jeff, but it did sting a bit more when she’d go talk to him normally and then shut down when I’d walk up so I thought it was worth the mention. We talked about it again but it never really improved.(it might have but it’s now out of season). 

Things began getting more and more uncomfortable. She’d be next to me and I’d see a few words here and there from there texts and it was soon pretty clear that he had feelings for her. Good morning and goodnight texts from him every day, things like “I love making you smile”, and “you’re the only one I really talk to”.  On top of this, Bleepblop would stay after class and talk to a group of people including Jeff even if we had plans to hang or go out. She would also give Jeff a ride home even if we had plans. (It should be noted at this point that I don’t believe that my girlfriend has cheated or that she has feelings for Jeff. This will be hard to believe after the next event I tell you, but she is just kind, feels a little bad for him,  and Jeff is quite manipulative(I’ll get into this later)). 

This is one is a big event, and could be its own post. I told her the night before that we needed to talk after class the next day. It was going to be about Jeff. I asked her specifically to come over right after class. I don’t remember exactly how this next part went but if anything it’s worse than I remember... so I went the entire day believing that was going to happen, but after practice when the time came she said she was too tired and just wanted to go home. I was confused and was like “but you’re supposed to come over so we can talk about important relationship stuff yknow?”. A few more texts and then she didn’t respond. I assumed she was just driving home which is 5-10 minutes away from her. I don’t remember the exact words of the following messages. After about half an hour I sent a text asking if she’s home yet. She said not yet, and added that she was taking Jeff home. So I asked where she was. She said she was in [name of town], I asked where in [name of town], and then she was like “what do you mean?”. That was a confusing response but at this point I knew that she was with Jeff at his house. I would find out (recently)that they stayed in her car in his driveway for multiple hours talking as opposed to the single hour I thought it was. So she ignored my request, lied about being too tired and wanting to go home, lied about being with Jeff, and she chose to do that over trying to talk out our problems... (I am very aware how terrible that looks... trust me...). She did not cheat on me with Jeff. My problem with this situation is the lying about it.

This was months ago and I literally have no clue how we moved past this.  I don’t remember it, I remember being upset for a while, and I remember talking about it, but I don’t remember ever actually getting closure or anything. 

This one has nothing to do with Jeff. This is already so long so I’ll leave out the intro.  So much more recently, bleepblop lies to me to stop me from going with her to a play. I found out and it brought up all of the negative feelings of being lied to before. When we talked about it(the play and the Jeff one) I told her my trust in her, the person I trusted most, was broken. I told her that I didn’t want to break up with her, but I had to decide if I ~needed~ to break up with her. the only reasons she gave for her actions we’re “I don’t know why I did it”. We were both crying. A lot. obviously. From the start, not just then. 

The limbo our relationship was in lasted a few weeks. Eventually i settled on people do dumb things for no reason sometimes. I’ve done it(not to this extent but yeah). 

Oh yeah, somewhere in there she finally acknowledged that Jeff does indeed have feelings for her. And I told her that he clearly doesn’t respect our relationship. So she finally texted him and asked “Do you respect [my name]?” Here’s a good time to add that she would tell Jeff when any problem was going on with us but would leave out her role in it.. so Jeff basically thought I was a terrible human being, well still does. His answer basically amounted to “no” lol. 

I’m gonna start moving very quickly. I’m so sorry, thank you to anyone still reading. She had to start being open after the lies so she was showing me texts between them and.. this kid has some problems. She didn’t tell him why she was upset for less a than 24 hours and he sent a giant, creepy paragraph filled with manipulation and just agh, I wish I could post it here, but I don’t want to him or anyone finding it. Lots and I mean lots of “I’m such a terrible friend if you can’t talk to me, I must be such an awful person and you would be better off without me” that’s an understatement as well or whatever the opposite of exaggeration is. So I’m pretty sure he had some idealized version of bleepblop in his head. I ended up speaking to him to tell him what was going down, I was very calm and respectful because it wasn’t really his fault that he hated me, but he basically ignored everything I said. It was kinda like talking to a 10 year old. 

He ended up telling my girlfriend to fuck off and other hurtful things because I told him she had been lying to us. For some reason she doesn’t see the manipulation and she thinks he’s a nice person and wants to continue being friends. I’ve told her that I am not comfortable with anything even close to what they did before.  I told her to not try to mend fences with him until we can talk about it. She talked to him anyway...

Would I be in the wrong for telling her not to be alone with him ever again? Or cut unnecessary contact all together? How can I help her see how messed up the things he’s done are? Er, just what do I do? I know from the outside she seems like this malicious, cheating person, but Jeff has been manipulative their entire relationship, and being in the situation it’s easier to see that. 

Pre-post update: We ended up talking before I got the chance to post it. She seems deadset on keeping him as a friend. I told her I’m not comfortable with her being alone with him and she seemed receptive to that, but after she left she brought up that she should be able to give him rides home. I told her I’m not comfortable with that and she seemed confused and called it silly. I explained clearly that I’m not comfortable with her being alone with the dude she has continuously lied to me about and she said that makes more sense.",relationship_advice

He broke our lease and left after an argument. To make a long story short, I moved out shortly after. (Thanks to understanding landlord). He didn’t speak to me for months and I didn’t bother contacting him. I moved out of state and didn’t look back.

Fast forward a few months later. My life has improved and I’m healing from the whole hurtful ordeal. He messaged me out the the blue to apologize for making us lose the apartment. I apologized for my role in things because I could have handled things different. I didn’t realize his moods leading up to the blowup were because of bipolar. He stopped taking his meds while we lived together. I wish I realized and this wouldn’t have happened.

We made amends and while we weren’t as close as before because of distance we still talked and checked on each other. And he mentioned seeing me when I came back to town because my family and everyone is there. He even wished me a happy thanksgiving. He’d posted depressing memes on Facebook so I commented that he’s a great person and that anyone who loses him is their loss.

The next day he deleted me off social media. No conversation. Nothing. Wouldn’t really respond to my messages either. I’m heartbroken why did he come back just to hurt me again? Some people say this is a mental illness thing but I don’t think so because I think I’m the only friend that got cut off. :(",relationship_advice

We have been married for 12 years and dated for 3 years before that. While most of the time our relationship has been amazing, there have been some bad times.  Those bad times have mainly consisted of me getting caught lying to her.  I admittedly had a problem with watching porn in the beginning of our marriage. She caught me and told me she didnt approve of me watching it. I told her i would stop. That turned out to be harder than i expected. She would ask me many times if there was anything I needed to tell her and I would say no.  She caught me a few more times with me always apologizing and promising not to do it again. I did finally manage to stop, but the level of trust had already been damaged.

To her credit, she was always willing to give me another chance.  

My job was extremly stressful and I wasnt sleeping well. I turned to over the counter sleeping pills to help. I slowly got addicted to them.  She knew something was up and would ask and I would deny that I was on something. I ended up losing my job(not because of the pills) and my addiction only got worse. I would constantly take them throughout the day to stay numb to my feelings. Again, always lying to her that there was anything going on. Fast forward to her going on vacation with our kids and I wasnt able to go, I took too many and blacked out. The next thing I remember I was standing in the middle of my street with the police. I was wandering around my neighborhood looking in mailboxes. I dont remember any of it.  They did not arrest me, they just made sure I got home safely. I didnt tell her about it because I wanted to tell her in person. When she got home I found a reason to put off telling her. The next day I was at my new job and the police came by checking up on me. She called me and asked me if I had anything to tell her and I said no.  She confronted me about the police coming to check on me. I was caught not being honest with her.

There has been a couple more incidents, but to not make this too long I skip those. Tonight she caught me in another lie. She wants me gone.  As I've said, most of our relationship is amazing. A few hours before this happened tonight she had told me how lucky she was to have me and how much she loves me.

She doesnt think I can be honest with her. I want to work this out and asked her for her help. She feels like she isn't the one that has fucked this up, I have, and I need to figure it out alone.

While I admit that I have caused all this, she could be very helpful in my understanding of why I cant always be honest with her. Our fight ended with her agreeing that if I could tell her why I cant be honest with her that she would take the next step with me in trying to fix it.

I truly love her and dont want to keep making the same mistakes over and over again. I just dont understand why it is so hard for me to be honest and could use some insight from people on the outside of our marriage.",relationship_advice

Needing Advice on a long distance relationship.

I’ve been dating a girl for a month now. Both of us 25 years of age and she lives about 14 hours away. She started getting feelings and claimed she loved me first after a week and a half. I didn’t think much of it, I guess I failed to notice if there was really anything wrong with it but I guess I had some of the same feelings as well. She was already mentioning how she wants to meet after the holidays which I also didn’t see a problem. What worries me is she’s always busy or claims to be and sometimes brings up the fact she was sleeping during the day while her kids are at her dads. I guess maybe I could be overthinking it. She’s a really good looking girl and a lot of guys hit on her constantly on fb and instagram which I know isn’t her fault. I’ve asked her also to video chat a few times and she keeps saying she will but hasn’t yet. I’m always the one to call her and she never does. The other night she was on the phone with me around 4am and randomly hung up cause her dog was growling and texted me saying her neighbor came over to ask for a phone charger and even though she said she would call me back she didn’t. I didn’t here from her the next day until I messaged her. She always claims that I’m the best thing to happen to her and wants me forever. I ended up going to her friend for advice because she was being really distant and being really weird and even though I asked her she would never tell me I just wanted to see if I was being crazy before I brought it up to her. Her friend told me that it wasn’t right and she was hanging around other guys that liked her and I was uncomfortable with it her friend and lashed out on her for being distant and lying to her as well and then she took it out on me and I left her because of the bullshit. I’m now in a situation where the day after I left her she got with the guy she told me not to worry about and she keeps sending me text messages wanting me back even though I try to push it away and stop texting her and I am in love with her and I keep trying to get her back and she keeps saying that she wants us and misses me and he means nothing even though I apologized for going to her friend just because I was worried. I tried to explain that to her but she said she couldn’t trust me I know I screwed up but it wasn’t a huge mistake that I couldn’t fix and I told her that I’m sorry over 100 times and she kept telling me that she loves me and wants us to be together but every time I try to push her away she keeps coming back and playing games with me and I don’t know what to do",relationship_advice
762,e6cehu,Wingardium-Levi0sa,1575522567.0,4,My (23M) casual partner (40F) and I are dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. We both want different things but I believe our fears are hindering a decision.,"I (23M) got my casual partner (40F) pregnant. As of today we've both only known each other for less than 2 months. We met on a dating app, and although our times together were insightful, thrilling and joyous… she initially impressed upon me that due to our age difference, she could not see the two of us traditionally dating (boyfriend and girlfriend) and that we’d instead just have “fun”. I accepted the terms. We both consensually agreed to unprotected sex since STD’s/STI’s were in the clear. I asked about her concerns about getting pregnant and she was confident that she could not get pregnant, sighting her years of trying and failing with a past partner. The deed happened and if had I intelligently asked if she was “medically confirmed sterile” I would have suggested a Plan B pill just in case. Being the idiot that I am. I did not. 

A month goes by in our casual relationship. We maybe saw each other a total of three times within that month. I do not believe she had sex with anyone else in the time we were not together, I surely did (safely) as we were not committed. She asked to meet me, and I figured this was a regular meetup… a night out, or just a night enjoying each others company at her place.

She told me she was pregnant to both of our surprise. She’d known this for sometime, and battled as to whether or not to tell me. I was calm and comforted her but my fears/emotions settled in later in the night. She cried hysterically, and told me that she could not face the depression that could comes with an abortion, and I later learned she had an abortion earlier in her life due to a violation of her mind, body and soul (rape). It was then, and there that I knew that there was no other option on the table. That a conversation equally weighted on both options (abortion or carry to term) was not on the table. It was clear she had already made up her mind to keep the baby the moment she found out she was pregnant. 

I completely understand and have no choice but to accept her right to do so as a women. She does not have to consider me when she makes her choice. It’s devastating to accept for me, but I’m all for bodily autonomy. 

We both processed the situation differently. When we couldn’t see each other, or talk, we wrote journals to each other. My journals consisted of my fears of not wanting to father a child at this time, sighting my inexperience as an adult (recent college grad), my own current psychological and self image struggles, my wanting to experience my youth, child-free, and my desire for complete spontaneity in my life. She related as she too chose to hold off on having kids so that she could focus on herself, her wants, her goals and have her freedom in life. 

She insisted that fatherhood did not mean that I had to give up my dreams. That I did not have to work multiple 9-5’s to make financial ends meet and that I could still do 20 year old deeds like go to bars with friends, go on dates with whomever, make dumb mistakes and so on. I think her views on this are naive, because even I know that is a load of hogwash. I know that I will have to make many sacrifices and that the parts of my life that are NOT completely sacrificed, will be unrecognizable. Yet, she keeps trying to convince me of a sugar-coated version of this reality which is frustrating. 

Financially, I work freelance, and do not have enough connections to offer me enough work to have enough money for myself outside of rent. I am technically as far as government is concerned below the poverty line. I can easily get food stamps but I choose not to. I am a frugal spender, but it works because I am only living for myself. She on the other hand has a more stable job, but it is not high-earning. So if things stayed the same in our current situation she will front the cost of everything. Medical, caretaking, clothing, food for the child, not to mention the cost of any treatments she would need after the effects of a pregnancy on her body and hospital fees, and finally regular old things like meals and rent etc. I know this is NOT sustainable but she insists she can make it work. I know I will have no choice but to work a 9-5 despite her telling me that I do not have to, which completely halts my own career goals (Freelance goes hand-in-hand with my desired career and will simply not flourish with a 9-5). 

Who could I go to for advice on this, especially as a male? My 20-year friends? Keeping this to myself was driving me deeper and deeper into my depression, and my panic attacks were frequent and unbearable. Thankfully, I found a free counseling program that deals with unexpected pregnancies. Our first session together, as a “couple” it was clear the focus was on me. There were 3 counselors asking me questions like: Why do you not feel you’re ready to be a father yet? What do you think you can do to start preparing to be a father? How could you communicate together to make sure we’re parenting efficiently? They told me that there are many joys in being a father and that it is wonderful experience to watch a child grow. Obviously, I was conflicted. This didn’t seem to be a place of much discussion as I'd hoped for. The deal was done. There was no consideration to anything else.

She wants me to be involved physically and emotionally in the child’s life. She’s made it clear that just paying child support (which I probably cannot even afford) is not her idealized vision, and that it will make her resent me. 

I brought up questions regarding the legalities of parenting (guardianship, parent rights etc.) because I was genuinely curious how something like this would work out in a court of law with our differences, she said she was unsure either and she was visibly upset that I brought this up because she’d hope we not have to go that far to sort things out and could just do so amongst ourselves on our word. 

I’ve lived with tremendous guilt over the most infinitesimal things in life thus far. I know that as easy as it is to just abandon her, or to just pay child support I will feel an unbearable amount of self-scrutiny and mental aguish, so for my own sanity I know that I have no choice but to say “fuck it” and follow suit. I don’t have it in me to disappoint, and she knows that and says it’s because I have a good heart. I believe I do, and I beat myself up for this. I wish I was cold-hearted. I wish I can just abandon them because it’ll be easier, but I cannot. 

There’s a part of me that feels like I’m just rolling over and am just not making as much as a fuss about it as I should. She is an extremely positive, and forward thinking person and for every issue I give she sees a positive outcome around it. She's determined. This is an excellent mindset to have, I understand, but I must admit it annoys me. 

Just recently, she expressed that she is falling in love with me and that she feels alone in this whole situation because I expressed that I may not feel the same way, and that I could fall in love with someone else down the road. I feel guilty to have hurt her by not reciprocating the same affections, but I cannot think about my feelings for her in the midst of all of my internal turmoil. I’ve accepted that I will have to contribute in some way even though it is the last thing I want to do, but do I now also owe it to her and this child to have a loving romantic relationship with her while doing so? 

I expressed earlier that I did consider her feelings and struggles and that I did care for her, to which she questions if I actually do, due to my expressions of ""coldness"". There are times where I simply do not want to talk to her or engage in a conversation with her as I process. 

My stance on the situation is pretty clear. I’m pro-choice and am firm believer in bodily autonomy so I feel bad because naturally with my stance I am essentially swaying her to have an abortion. I’m not flat out telling her she should have one, but I’m telling her why I do not think the child is a good idea for both of us at this moment, which in a sense is pretty clear I’d prefer her to terminate. She has my word that I will stick by her side if she were to terminate, so her reservations about not doing this is not because she feels I will run away and get off scott free. 

It does concern me that her decision making is based off fear from a past abortion following a horrible experience. Her fears are valid, and I can definitely see her reservations. Those circumstances back then weren't ideal to have a child. Are these? 

Our age difference was enough to cause her to initially not be interested in a relationship, is co-parenting with someone 17 years younger than her something she really wants? And if so, why? 

She told me that she does not want to face the judgment of her peers at work, and has made it a point to go out and buy baggy clothing, so that it can become a norm in the eyes of her peers, and that when she does start showing a pregnancy bump it will be concealed by the baggy clothing, in hopes it will not raise an eyebrow.

Ultimately, I understand that I must atone for my mistakes, and pay the consequences of them. I am aware that I am showing signs of selfishness because I prefer my own outcome as oppose to hers. 

I do not want to believe she is ill-intentioned, and it hurts to even consider that she may be because she's been pretty understanding, and says she does consider my worries. I feel maybe pregnancy hormones could be influencing some of the more rash comments or behaviors from her but it is hard to know if I am being manipulated, and it is also hard to check my own actions and thoughts for fear of possibly being seen as doing the same to her. All in all I do not think I am mentally or emotionally prepared to engage in a constructive conversation with her surrounding this as there are many conflicts within myself. 

The pregnancy is still early (1st Trimester) and anything could happen. Am I seeing things too negatively? What is your advice on how to move forward with a dialogue that will help us both reach a consensus from the perspective of complete clarity? We are both in fear of something and I know that does not make for the best of conversations. Thanks.

763,e6ceel,TheBronzeKneecap_69,1575522556.0,2,A girl I'm talking to still hangs out consistently with her ex. How am I supposed to feel?,"Her (22F) and I (22M) have hung out a few times now and its been great. We have plenty of common interests and hobbies and I enjoy her personality. However, I just learned that she still hangs out with her ex one-on-one. I've been trying to make some strides in maturity lately and not let things like this bother me, but the fact is that I'm still in a very insecure place with myself and something like this makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to voice my concern as we're not even officially dating and I don't want her to distance herself from her friends, but I could easily see myself making this a problem later on.

Is this something that's just part of being an adult that I need to suck up and get over, or is this a valid thing to take issue with?

We love each other and we’ve obviously  matured so yeah we have sex. I’m on birth control and we use condoms when I’m ovulating, I have an app to track it since I definitely don’t wanna get pregnant. So we’re responsible. I didn’t talk to my parents about it, I was on birth control anyway because my periods were irregular and it’s just awkward to tell my mom that I’m having sex. So I didn’t tell them. 

Well I was with my boyfriend in my room and we were having sex. My parents weren’t home they were supposed to be out the whole night. They got home early, I didn’t hear the car since I wasn’t expecting them to be back so I wasn’t listening for it. And they saw my boyfriends car in the driveway so I’m guessing they just came straight for my room. It was really embarrassing because they just barged in and we were obviously naked and it was just humiliating. My boyfriend tried saying sorry and my dad just started screaming and literally hit him with a tennis racquet and chased him out. He was terrified. He ran out so fast he left his phone and socks and they grounded me for having him over without asking them and for having sex because I’m too young. They even threatened to take my bedroom door away and I’m not allowed to have him upstairs anymore, only in the living room or kitchen and my parents have to be home too. My mom doesn’t understand either because she waited until marriage to have sex so she supports my dad. 

It was just so embarrassing. They literally saw me naked, God I feel insanely embarrassed about the whole thing. Like my worst nightmare came true. And my boyfriend is terrified. I know he loves me and I love him but I’m worried he doesn’t wanna be together anymore. Since the whole thing happened, he hasn’t been texting me as much and I feel like he just thinks it’s a weird situation that he doesn’t wanna be apart of. He’s just really scared of my parents now and I don’t know what to do. I feel like things are weird now. It sucks. Things were awesome before. And now we can’t see each other outside of school since my parents want me home right after. Even during our lunch period, I asked him if he wanted to drive to somewhere empty and have sex in his car and he said no. It just feels like he’s been acting withdrawn. I know sex is a big deal and he’s probably thinking we won’t be doing it anymore so he’s turned off, but we can still do it during lunch and stuff. And once I’m not grounded anymore, I can say I’m joining an after school club and we can hang out then. I know my parents absolutely overreacted and he’s freaked out and probably thinking about the pros and cons of being with me but I’m worried he’s gonna dump me.",relationship_advice

770,e6cb8w,daintysunflower,1575522102.0,2,My boyfriend (M20) didn’t tell me he was talking to another girl (F19),"Basically I was visiting his family in Houston and there were 20+ people. I had an awesome time there and I loved all the people there. 

I woke up early and noticed my boyfriend forgot to charge his phone. I plugged it in and saw a girl messaged him on Snapchat. This girl also unfriended me on Snapchat. 

To be fair, the only thing the girl had ever done was be mildly racist towards me. My boyfriend also got mad one time when I asked if we could just hang out together and I asked if she didn’t come. It was a misunderstanding and he was having a bad day. 

I respected his privacy so I did not open it and left it alone. I still had a great time there and was overall happy with the trip. I was feeling super bad one night at his relatives place so it wasn’t all good, but it may have affected us. 

I forgot about it and left it alone for a few days. Her name was brought up again and it kinda triggered me into thinking horrible things. I also said some things about her to a friend that were uncalled for and I felt really jealous. 

I got mad at my boyfriend today for not telling me about it. He said I was stressed out with the family and he didn’t have time to tell me. He told me she invited him to go to an AA meeting and he said no to it. I believe him, but I told him I don’t trust him.

When I met this guy, let’s call him Bojack, he tried to kiss me. I was in a relationship at the time so I wanted nothing to do with it, but internally the sparks were there, we hit it off so well, and if given different circumstances I might’ve kissed him back.

I told him we should to cut ties, even though I was on the fence, because I still  really wanted to be friends. Eventually I ended my then relationship, but that’s another story.

...So this guy, is extremely charming. He’s sweet, sensitive, knows just what to say... we barely knew each other and he bought me an extravagant gift, took me out to dinner, bought drinks a lot. Through the breakup he took me under his wing, and told me I should focus on someone else to help move on. To me this is key, because at the time I was vulnerable, and extremely emotional. Back then it seemed he was always so helpful. Always going out of his way. He was financially independent so he was able to be. In exchange I practically was his toy/doll. We’d hang out at his place and I’d let him do whatever he wanted to me. For some reason I always felt indebted to him, or that it was the least I could do. And to me, I liked it, so no harm. Every time I hung out with him, it was guaranteed to go back to his place.

At some point I felt myself developing a crush. But I didn’t want to disturb the current relationship we had, which was simply a FWB but with more affection and friendship. 

Once I had successfully moved on from my breakup, he started to communicate less and less until it was very minimal. I think I was no longer a challenge to him, but he still wanted to communicate just enough so I’d stick around.

Fast forward to now, we hung out the other day at our usual bar. Another girl walked in- someone I’d met the night I met him (she lives right next to the bar so she frequents it a lot). Let’s call her Sarah Lynn. He invited her over because “she’s fucked up right now”, going through tough times, she’d gotten evicted and didn’t want her to be alone. I liked her when we first met, so of course I wanted to make her feel included. 

Immediately I noticed the physical affection he had towards her. How he used his “soothing” voice on her, with the pet names he usually regards me with. It made me uncomfortable, but we were all having fun with games so I wasn’t going to walk out. Eventually he asked if she would host us 3. So we hung out at her place after. Both of us were in his arms on her bed. A few times he’d slip his hand underneath my underwear, underneath the blankets we had. I peered to his other hand, and I can imagine it was the same under her blanket because his hand wasn’t on top. At some point he commented how we both have the cutest little t**s because Sarah Lynn was saying how she has such a small chest. That remark, to me, said everything. After some conversation I learned he had given her gifts as well, and was going to be hosting her after her eviction date. 

I’m not jealous, but I am bothered he’s using the same tactics on her as he did me. Right now I feel really foolish, because I had such a positive image of him in my head. I thought I could never speak ill of him. But that night, it was extremely unsettling, and my gut feeling said I should cut ties to this person because he’s only manipulating me. Am I being ridiculous or does this seem like an appropriate response? At the same time, I have this feeling of “well what if I’m wrong”. He was such a good friend. 
If it’s relevant, all of his past girlfriends have only been ages 19-23. 

I appreciate anyone who could manage to read this far and offer some advice, to either get over myself or to get away from the guy. Thank you guys.",relationship_advice
774,e6c815,jakeishness,1575521628.0,1,Roommate romance drama,"Ok so this is kinda a long story and I need some advice. I met this girl at a Cafe and became friends. We started hanging out and eventually, after many encounters, I told her I was interested in her romantically. She said she was just out of a relationship and wasn't ready to date and she saw me just as a friend. Cool no problem. She's one of my closest female friends and I was just shooting a shot. After that we would do some light flirting but it was just something I took as just goofs. 

A few months go by and I need a room mate. And so does she. So I move in and everything is going swimmingly! We're hanging out and one night we're in her room watching a show in her bed. We happen to be spooning and as the big spoon my arm is under her neck. I start to feel her kissing my arm. Welp. I guess I should take this as a sign (not that the fact she let me spoon with her in her bed was one) that she liked me. So I kissed her.

We end up kinda dating(?) but I never really progress with her to anything sexual because of our loving situation. Wanted it to be slow so she wouldn't feel like I was intruding. We have this non sexual only kissing and pda kinda dating thing for like 3 months (😑). I go home for Christmas and while back home I decided that when I come back I'm gonna try and make whatever we had going on more official. And I get a text from her on the plane ride home saying she doesn't want to do whatever we were doing anymore. I say I'm disappointed but I'll respect her wishes (once again room mate and super broke. Don't wanna rock the boat).

A year goes by and everything is cool! We're pretty much just acting like friends act and bam. She brings a boy home. Long story short on that, I realize in a rush my feelings have only grown in that year towards her and I'm devistaed. I tell her how I feel and of course she says she doesn't feel that way for me. I can't be in the house when they're home, I can't see them together, I am an emotional mess! I finally start to grasp at the acceptance and calm down though I'm still crushed.  That boy only lasted a few weeks and then he was gone for good.

I could finally take that time to get my shit together. Fast forward another year today. She met another guy and has been going on dates. Nothing serious she tells me. (she rightfully worried about my reaction and gives me a heads up)  this time it's not a problem. It sucks but I'm actually feeling OK. 2 dates go by and she goes on a third. She stays at his place. And now. I start feeling the pain again. It's definitely not as bad as it was last time where it felt like I was bodyslammed into a pool of emotion and crippling heart break, but I was angry I still felt this way.  Now it feels more like a crush in high-school but I definitely still like her a lot. 

This time I haven't told her how I feel. And that's the problem. Should I even bring up how I feel to her or should I keep it to myself.  Sadly I can't move out rn but I think regardless of my future with this girl I will be doing so as soon as I can with fair notice to her of course.

775,e6c79g,advicehalpplzthx,1575521513.0,0,My (30F) SO's (33M) nephew (20M) is coming to live with us and...the title wont fit all the people involved,"Hi. First time posting on reddit ever because I usually lurk via my SO's account but this situation feels messy and I need advice.

SO and I have been together for 5+ years. Our roommate is moving out and his nephew is coming to live with us in January due to his graduating college. His career choice has a large field where we live. Lets call him Paul. Paul's a sweet kid and I like him. I'm happy the timing is working out to where we can be here for him to give him a soft landing in a new state. SO's family doesn't live close, so the times I've spent with Paul have been during family events/holidays and he's a good kid.

Paul is my SO's nephew by marriage. My SO has a younger sister, maybe a year older than me. I have met my SO's siblings, his parents, aunts, uncles...and I've met Paul's father. Lets call him Brett(41M).

Brett was 27 when he started to pursue my SO's sister. She was 16-17 at the time, and a student of his. Paul was already 5-6 years old and his mother had passed away. Brett saw it fit to make a move on his high school student and have a secret relationship with her, until phone bills were checked and some detective work done to determine whoTF she was speaking to that was running up the cell bills. Obviously during all this I too was only 15-16 years old and meeting my SO wasn't going to happen for another 10 years, but this is how Paul became my SO's nephew. Brett and my SO's sister dated (her first BF and everything ever), married when she finished college, and they divorced about 2 years ago. During this time my SO and surrounding family members tried to make Paul feel as welcome as possible and even though Brett isn't a son-in-law anymore, Paul still has full family privileges.

My SO told me that he spoke with Paul today. Brett wants to come to help with the transition. I'm being told he's looking to stay here in our apartment with us for 3-4 days. I'm not comfortable with Brett being in my apartment. He makes me feel uncomfortable. Knowing how he targeted my SO's sister when she was just a child in addition to his personality in the times I've been around him make it clear to me he doesn't respect women. I know the past is the past and everything has already played out as it did. I know I'm not my SO's parents and I didn't live through the process of having my teenaged daughter telling me she's ""in love"" with her teacher. I know my opinions on ""how I would handle it"" are irrelevant. However I feel that my SO's family normalizing Brett's predatory behavior is THEIR choice, and in this instance when it's about Brett coming into my house, I should have a choice?

My SO says there's no way we can have Paul come live with us without Brett being as involved as he wants. He says there's no way he can tell Brett that he's not welcomed in our home. My SO agrees that Brett's tactics with his younger sister are in poor taste and that he's never genuinely liked the guy either, but in his nature is neutral when it comes to confronting people/behaviors he doesn't like and will avoid conflict 99% of the time, even if it's to communicate a healthy boundary. I like my SO's parents, but we're not close enough to talk about this. I told my SO I think it's reasonable to have Paul move in and Brett can stay in a hotel and only kind of help facilitate the process with his kid..but why does Brett have to STAY HERE? Like. In our house? Paul is 20 and is independent enough to move to a new state where is uncle lives to start work. Paul's already lived a few years in another state away from his father to go to college. I feel bad because I like Paul and I don't want to take a safe option away from him due to my opinion of his father. However I really dislike the character Brett has displayed and I don't feel like I can just look the other way as this man becomes more involved in my life, I feel it's within my right to have a boundary implemented here. SO says that I can't implement a boundary with someone who's backstory didn't even affect me? And that I need to get better at putting up with people I don't like. I understand that if his whole family has walked on eggshells for years around the origins of how Brett married their daughter that by me saying ""lol nope pedo creep"" it seems like it's coming out of no where...but again. Their choice to be okay with Brett is theirs to make. Can't I also have a choice on how okay or not I am with having him around?

After typing all this up I feel like the advice is going to be along the lines of ""don't open up a can of worms, if you're happy with your SO and his family just put up with this Brett guy to help Paul"" but I guess I'm just hoping to hear advice that doesn't make me feel like people have given up on real communication and real talk. And maybe that I'm not so alone in my feelings of being grossed out by this man.

There was so much tension and needing and slow revealing of feelings. He would want to do \*adult stuff\* multiple times a day, like he could never get enough, we would exchange texts ranging from super sweet and adorable to spicy and exciting, we would play video games together all the time. It was all really good and made me feel so wanted. And he was busy too, working a stressful, full time job. We’d go weeks without seeing each other sometimes, but it worked. 

A month or two ago, things abruptly died down. We both started school in September, we have been seeing each other all the time, but only more recently did things start to just…wind down. And I’m heartbroken. He’s still very loving, but now wants to do \*things\* a few times a week. When I asked why we hadn’t done anything in two days, he just said he hadn’t felt like it and reassured me I was still attractive to him. Part of this is me not taking initiative enough probably, but it’s difficult when he doesn’t even give me an opportunity sometimes. He never wants to play games with me anymore, and when we are apart for a few days he never texts me the way he used to, and when he knows I’m upset he doesn’t bother to call or anything. We're both busy with school but that doesn't make *me* want to do those things less. 

I know what the honeymoon phase is, and I know passion fades, but I’m still so upset. It’s only been 10 months. We’ve been friends for years and always have had amazing chemistry, and I still feel it, i still feel all the same passion, but lately it seems like he doesn’t. I try to make out with him and he doesn’t reciprocate. I want him to throw me against a wall again and he never does. I try to initiate but he doesn’t get it. Am I overreacting?

I'm (20F) friends with this guy (20M) that I've had several classes with since my first semester in college; right now we're finishing up the first half of our Junior year and we've had at least one class together every semester. We just finished working on a huge, semester-long project that culminated in spending about 25 hours working together over the course of 4 or 5 days. To keep details as vague as possible, the public ""unveiling/viewing"" of the project is on Friday night (right now it's Wednesday night) and on Monday he texted me that he hoped I had a good Thanksgiving and said he ""was wondering if I could accompany you to \[event\] on Friday night?"" I thought the wording was a little weird but said sure (we were already both going) and then tonight as we were leaving class he asked if I wanted him to walk me over from my dorm. It's about a ten minute walk and it'll already be dark out (we live downtown in a busy city), so I said that sounds good.

I don't *not* like him romantically, I just kind of figured that three years in, something would've happened by now so it's better to stay friends - plus, weird timing, I'm moving home in nine days for the end of the semester and then spending the spring abroad in another country (he knows this).

782,e6c1wj,Prutpot_92,1575520725.0,2,GF went out with a guy she met last summer. I find this a date she doesn't.,"Tl;Dr; at the bottom.

First some background: My GF(27F) and I(27M) (europeans) have been together for little more than 3 years now. We bought a house together half a year ago, and in general we never really have issues anymore since have something like a ""your turn to hold the wooden spoon your turn to talk"" moment each week. I saw this once on a program about relationships, and although there's nothing being said most of the times, it really helps our relationship since I don't always communicate that good and sometimes there are things that bother each other.

I'll try to be as factual about it as I can because I already got biased opinions from both sides and I need a neutral party for a third opinion.

History: after we dated and became a couple (3months) she met a guy while going out. Flirted with him (she did not seduce him) and kept flirting with him via text until things escalated to which she said she would stop it. But actually it had to escalate a second time where I wanted to see the text and caught her red handed again. She made clear she didn't want to stop flirting but stopped anyway for me. She thought it was ok for her because she's a girl (who is scientifically less likely to cheat), but O couldn't do the same though... I'm a male.
Looking back she cheated emotionally (if that's a thing). Now I would be done with us, even with the house, but back then I was still blindly in love so we worked past it.

What happened: in august my GF went with her best friend on a canyoning/adventure group travel camp. The same period I did something similar with my best friend. Group travel, so we met new people. We're young, so we partied.
They made two close male friends from our country. One lives half an hour from us (F1) the other a little over two hours (F2).
By coincidence I know F1, I studied with him for a year.
They talk regularly via whatsapp in our group or personal chat.
She met up with only the guys to go to the beach until 1am during a work week. (I was bothered with it but didn't bring it up because I know F1)
There was a housewarming for their group of 4. She told me I had to make sure not to be at home then. But that same day it was already planned i would roll out new grass in our garden so it overlapped and I met them briefly before I left.
After work she sometimes goes to the gym with F1. (We can't go together because she uses my membership to enter, which she shouldn't supposed to use like that)
Last weekend F2 came to our house to pick her up and go to a Christmas market where they hung out from 5pm till 2 am. It was also her birthday a couple weels ago so he also had a gift. I knew he would come since this stood in our agenda and she briefly told me about it. But I was under the impression it would be with the entire group.
The only other thing I know about him is that they are on the phone when they have to drive 1+ hours.

Her opinion: I went out with a friend like you do with your friends. (I have a larger group of friends from high school I regularly hang out with. She doesn't) And I didn't know the destination. (Which I find odd since she's not like that at all)

My opinion: you basically went on a date with a guy you know 4 months. Who gave you a 35euro gift. And with whom you talk on the phone with for hours. I've seen this before and know where this leads.

She didn't see anything wrong with it. I find it very much a lack of respect towards me, even if it was just with a friend. And i was and still am angry about it.

I asked opinions.
Her BF: it's OK. there's nothing wrong with that.
My closest friends and sister: they sharey opinion, disrespectful.

We talked about it again.
She turned and said she understands me but doesn't see a problem with hanging out with a friend for 8+ hours who she knows 4 months and drives 2+hours to meet her. (They have to meet for this long otherwise it isn't worth it to drive this far) It escalates to not OK when you also talk with him on the phone for hours.
She compared it to other times she hung out with male friends (from work). But this is different for me since it wasn't an 8 hour date to a Christmas market (which have a romantic setting in my opinion) and because I knew more about them.
She thinks that with her explanation I should get over it, but I think she just wants this to be over and fear might happen again.

I don't want to limit her freedom as she said in our first argue. But I think being in a closed relationship is setting the limits and I'm just reaffirming those limits.

A lot more has been said but that's the gist of it.

So to conclude, am I seeing/understanding this wrong since I have a large group of friends that live close by (half an hour) and she doesn't? Or am I right that this is a lack of respect? Please give me your unbiased opinion on this.

Tl;Dr; GF went to a Christmas market for 8+hours with a male friend she knows for about 4 months. I think she's dating, she thinks this is fine.",relationship_advice

There is a girl that I have known for about four years, and we are friends but not extremely close. I sit with her at lunch everyday, but rarely make conversation, as she usually talks to other people. She is very nice to me and occasionally compliments me but has never talked to me first. She will respond if I text but I think it is only out of politeness, as she keeps it short and impersonal. (This May because I am a notoriously bad texter or maybe because she doesn’t like talking to me)

I like her very much, but I have teased her regularly in the past. I didn’t do it out of spite or dislike, but as most immature 12yr olds are, it was more of a personality defense mechanism. I have been nice and apologized for my previous jokes as much as I can without being weird.

I would like to ask her out eventually , but I am afraid of ruining our friendship. My question is, how can I talk to her more without being strange? 

I wish I could start over and meet her again so that her impression of me could be different.

I have been with my partner sean for 3 years. we are great together, I love him more than anything, and he feels the same about me. we are currently long distance as I am in school, but it really hasn't been that difficult, just an adjustment. anyway, on to the main.

his family is very different from mine. his parents are out of the picture, he has been on his own since he turned 17. sean moved his brother henry (30M) in with him when henry got out of prison, because he wanted to take care of his brother. at first things with henry were good - he got a job, he seemed happy, he started dating. great! we all used to hang out together and have fun. but about a year ago henry did something that would have sent him back to jail had sean not fixed it for him. this caused sean a lot of stress, but we kind of understood where henry was coming from when he made that mistake. henry did some other things over the past few months that caused sean a lot of stress as he had to fix all of those mistakes, but he was willing to do so for his brother. honestly from my perspective, henry manipulates sean into giving a lot without doing anything in return. I am biased because I see all the stress that henry puts on sean, but it really does hurt to see sean throw himself into taking care of someone who literally does nothing in return. sean rents out a room in his house to henry at a discounted rate, and even let henry move his new girlfriend in with no warning.

last month, henry's girlfriend threatened to break up with him, causing henry to 'freak out' in sean's words. I was not there to see this happen, but long story short sean had to take henry to the hospital and said that if anything like that happened ever again he would kick henry out. obviously something did happen, which is why I am here today.

last week, henry finally got violent with his girlfriend, so sean threw him out. henry then began threatening to hurt himself, harassing the girlfriend (now ex, obviously), and sean had to call the cops multiple times. it got so bad that the girlfriend moved out of sean's house even though she had nowhere else to go. I mean, she would rather sleep in her car than deal with henry harassing her, and there really wasn't anything sean could do. I really thought this was it, sean kept telling me how he was done with henry, how he didn't want him back in his life. then, as soon as I left, henry called sean and asked to be taken to the hospital. he was put in a 72-hour hold after being processed from the ER. while in the ER, sean found out that there was meth in henry's system.

after all of this, henry has basically moved back in with sean. I recognize that he is family and it isn't as simple as just cutting him off. but it feels like sean will just be caught up in taking care of henry and fixing all of his messes for the rest of his life. henry has a number of mental illnesses but he refuses to stay on his medications. I don't judge him for his illnesses, I judge him for being a 30-year-old man child who manipulated and I would say abused his girlfriend. I love sean. I would love to be supportive of him taking care of his brother. but his brother should not need taking care of at his age.

here is my issue: **would it be horrible and manipulative of me to tell sean that if he allows henry to move back in with him, I would feel unsafe visiting and would not be able to see a future with him?** I don't want to throw away what we have, but honestly I could never feel safe visiting overnight (which is what my visits would be, we are long distance), I could never see myself moving in with him as long as he's essentially parenting his brother.",relationship_advice
786,e6bzz4,ThrowRAAmerican,1575520457.0,1,How to do I (21M) deal with a dysfunctional family and what is the next step.," Some background INFO, I lived in America for most of my life and I liked it. My parents moved to America and it was good at first, but it had its ups and downs. But it the last couple of years, It wasn't that pleasant in that my parents argue a lot, and I just get tired of it. My Dad and Mom argue about money and while my dad is the sole breadwinner, he spreads his mom in ideas without thinking much. His parents sell the land back in my country and built a nice house while here in America we have to budget. Whenever there is an argument about money, he tells us it's my money I will do what I want. As a result, we appear to be tight on money while he goes and spreads it without thinking much. 

My dad also has a temper as he is stressed out and it kills the mood most of the time. Whenever he is outside, he doesn't talk to use and he is on his phone and talks about how much money he is going to make with his new venture with his partner when in reality I think it will never happen and its all a joke to me. When we tell him the truth, he gets mad and says we don't have a job, his money and basically shut up.  He pays a good amount in credit card interest when in fact he could give up his business interest, which he invested and failed all the time so far. He is too ignorant and he thinks he is right and he is the laughing stock of my family friend circle.

When it comes to my mom, the mood in the house doesn't improve in that she needs me for everything when she can do it herself. If she doesn't have something in her favor, she gets mad and gets everyone else mad. Whenever I'm eating, I ask that she not yell about something and for some reason, we argue when I'm eating and it gets me mad. On top of that, all my other family friends are becoming doctors and I tell her it is hard and she takes it to the next level and say I will never become a doctor, leading to another issue. She argues with my dad with money on how his parents are spending more money when there in there 80s while we have to look for deals, and this has been going on for the last week.

With my dad ignorant that my money I do whatever I want and my mom's behavior gaslighting him I'm kind of tired with this. I don't show emotion since my dad makes the money and I don't want to be kicked out yet so I need his money until I'm stable position and I'm tired with my mom yelling at me and my dad. I most likely, I'm going to deal with this until I graduate and get into a medical school which at the earliest is 2021. So the advice I'm asking is

1. How to best deal with the situation I have without destroying my mental health at the moment
2. Is cutting off all contact with them once I get into medical school a good idea.

787,e6bzwv,ParGoGo,1575520449.0,1,No experience... Or at least that's how it was,"Hi, I'm a female college but graduated at early, so still not over 20. Just recently (this year) I had my first couple relationships - I was very insecure growing up-. Before them I hadn't really had sex (I had done other stuff but it didn't go very far, ever) which for someone considered attractive (as seen by people after I got more confident) is fairly odd in my country, where sexual experiences start fairly early on.

The first one ended very shortly, didn't even last two months. I didn't really like anything about the other person - they just made me horny-. We didn't see each other often, and when we did, we didn't have anything to talk about. I was extremely honest about my experience -or lack thereof- when it came ti anything even vaguely sexual. So when we met up we mostly just kissed, mutually masturbated or dry humped. So anyways I broke up with them.

Fast forward a couple of months, I met another person, I wasn't as open with them, and only vaguely pointed to my inexperience. This one time I joked he thought of me -before he met me- as 'pure and innocent' (we were definitely talking about sexual relationships) but he said he asummed I had my experience.

I had told some of my friends about how I didn't really talk to my now ex, and we only did other stuff (the only kissing and dry humping person) ... It seems, both due to my vague description and imagination running rampant, this friend definitely thought I was only ever having sex with my ex. 

So.... The point is, I never really told my current partner I was a ""virgin"" (hate the word, and it's archaic history... Which is what mostly led to all of this), at least that's how it was until I first had sex with them. The thing is, I don't know how to tell them, cause I belive in my panic of knowing I we would do it pretty often (going by my libido), but he would be very cautious around an inexperienced person, I don't really remember if I ever made myself look more experienced than I really was.

Basically I don't know if I ended up doing anything to actively hide my inexperience leading to me lying. 

I feel like the topic of experience is popping up a lot lately -including talks with friends and with my partner-. 

So please, tell me what would you do in this situation?

She said that she had a lot of homework but she would let me know. I like to talk to girls through Snapchat with pics and videos as they make the convo more entertaining.

I introduced her to every single one and she looked super happy. We had a great time and they all really liked her. Then I had to take her home. Still having great conversations. When I dropped her off she thanked me and gave me a hug in my car and left smiling.

I know from my experience with anxiety and depression that the medication, that I eventually got off, was a tool that made the coping mechanisms learned through therapy easier, which ultimately lead to my recovery, not solely the medication. She has this mindset that whenever she gets in extreme stress and feels overwhelmed she should just increase her dose and I try and tell her that it is not going to make the anxiety go away, it is resetting your thought patterns that will alleviate the anxiety. 

I've suggested she goes to therapy but she doesn't seem into the idea and I obviously can't force her, not to mention not everyone is the same so my recovery path may not be the same as what hers would be.

Yes I know it was her past, it happened before we met and she hasn't been in contact with them since before we met either but is this normal for me to feel betrayed at the fact that I was lied to or should I let it go?

Her argument is that it's none of my buisness since it was before I was in her life (which I completely agree with) but I still seem to feel hurt by it and also feel that there is a lack of trust now with how things in her past actually were. I know your past is what makes you who you are, but part of me feels like I don't truly know her how I thought I did. She is still a great woman, I love her and have never had reason to not take her word for things but now I feel like I am second guessing things when it comes to taking her word, even though it is something as dumb as her lying about a couple guys from ages ago that is causing these feelings I now have.

I'm just looking for some opinions on the situation.

792,e6bygq,ScarletDeep,1575520247.0,2,Being compared to the Ex,"So me(17F) and my boyfriend(17M) have been dating since early September and he’s been very open about his past relationship and how abusive it was. He has ptsd and terrible nightmares because of it and I try to help him as much as I can, but every time we hang out he brings her up into the conversation. For example we were at a local park and out of the blue he said ‘thats where me and jane (fake name) had our first kiss.’ It hurt a lot honestly, I mean we were on a date and he brings that up? I don’t want to hear that. But I let it continue because I think it may be a way to heal for him. 
I am confident in the relationship we have but he keeps bringing her up and comparing how much better I am than her and it worries me how much he thinks about her. I want to bring it up with him but I don’t want him to he mad or take it the wrong way. How do I talk to him about it without making me sound mean?",relationship_advice
793,e6bybb,c-o-o-l-w-h-i-p,1575520223.0,2,My partner (M24) won't spend time with me (M19),"Mods, please delete this if this doesn't follow the guidelines! I apologize in advance if it doesn't.

My partner and I have been together for nearly two years now. The first year of our relationship was great. At the beginning of 2019, we talked about getting an apartment and moving in with each other since we lived an hour apart. Now that we're currently living together, it just feels like the guy I first started dating, no longer exists. 

Since moving in together, I feel like I've been pushed to the side. He tends to focus more of his attention on video games and his friends. He won't eat with me, or eat anything that I cook (and I'm not a terrible cook either). He will not agree nor disagree with any plans that I propose, but will leave to go hangout with his friends without mentioning it, and without inviting me. That makes me feel kind of disrespected and insulted. He wouldn't come over to any family dinners when he was invited, and that makes my parents unhappy and makes them feel like they did something wrong. He won't sleep in the same bed with me, nor touch or kiss me. We haven't been intimate in months!

When I gained the courage to confront him on how I felt, he just seemed to agree with everything and pretty much saw what I wanted to hear. He even suggested we take a break. I was taken back by that. He said he would slowly try to be more involved and try to spend time with me, but I haven't seen any changes.

I feel like I'm the reasons that he's pushing me away but I'm not sure what I'm doing? It's upsetting that I've even found myself in this position. What can I do to help better this relationship?

&#x200B;

TLDR: My partner doesn't spend time with me, hasn't been intimate with me in anyway, and it makes me feel like I'm the reason. What can I do to help better this relationship?",relationship_advice

795,e6bxtv,moanaa_33,1575520154.0,1,How do I fix this ?,"Am I a terrible friend for this ???

need friend advice....

I had this friend who I’ve known for years....   (sorry it might me long) 

we hung out with these 2 guys...but I noticed my friends crush (thing1) would have more of a conversation with me. This guy seemed like he was more interested in getting to know me to even complementing me on how pretty I would look right infront of my friend and his.

Long story short my friend and thing1 were talking since he had to in order to be close to me since he started everything off on the wrong foot and didn’t know how to tell me his feelings bc he thought I was still talking to his friend..this resulted in my friend really doing whatever she could to get him to notice her, but I wasn’t 100% sure at the time that this guy thing1 had a real crush on me... more than him being nice and complimenting me sometimes. he just seemed like a really nice friend and we had a lot in common. But yet he wasn’t all that innocent he at times would lead her on & any little thing he would do my friend would get the wrong signals and hope of something which was never there. So this must have all been less than 2months when my friend was still trying sooo hard for him to take the next step in really dating and being official.. but this guy just felt so much pressure and kept telling her he didn’t really feel the same until one day he really went off and let her know it was going to be nothing and I can’t remember at that time what he might have said but time went by like couples months and we connected again and he finally tells me he really liked me and wanted to see where it went. I was conflicted because I had gotten to know him during the time we were all friends and I thought he was really nice and again we had a lot in common. 

I didn’t know how to tell my friend because she literally had become obsessed with this guy it seemed like she really insisted and wanted this guy so bad and I just knew it would hurt her, but at the same time I felt like she knew deep down that he didn’t want her and she was still chasing him around and got her hopes up for nothing when all the signs were there and she didn’t care.

Me and my friend go out to eat one day and she starts telling me how she always felt like this guy thing 1 really liked me and wanted to know me. I told her that I thought that as well but I wasn’t so sure because maybe he was just being nice ..by the time thing 1 confessed to me his feelings I later decided to have a serious convo with her and let her know what thing 1 told me...I never had a guy really Persue me and take so much interest in me he let me know how bad he felt about my friend and he even apologized to her and wanted to move forward. 

My friend ofcourse made it a huge deal I told her I was torn between wanting to see where it goes with this guy, yet hurting her because I knew she liked him. but I told her that she knows me best and knows I would never purposely try to hurt her in any way and even tho that happened with that guy she knows my heart and knows what I’ve been through I finally meet this guy and because of the terrible circumstances I feel bad it ever happened that way and i would never do such a thing unless I was 100% he was serious about me.. next thing you know we give it a try and 2years later we are still together doing amazing and seeing a future together. 

so moving forward I thought we would pull through from it but her anger and grudge only grew bigger despite of her now dating his cousin she holds this grudge and jealousy over me talking about me behind my back and trying to humiliate me. She’s now within my bfs family since she’s dating the cousin.

Im in such a bad situation with her because of all the drama she’s caused in between for so long I felt terrible because of how it happened and now I’m just exhausted of looking like the bad guy even tho I feel like I did all I could as a friend to speak up and let her know what was going on and trying to be an adult about it.

800,e6bw7v,awkextrovert,1575519929.0,2,Bf (26M) left me (20F) stranded??? Also acting strange..,"Lol ok so it wasn’t stranded, but I was just getting out of school and my bf was supposed to pick me up.. I was in the library and was waiting for him to call me to let me know when he was a few minutes away. He called me and as soon as we hung up, i packed my bag and left the library. When I got out less than 5 minutes later walking to the loop area where he was supposed to pick me up, he was calling me repeatedly as I was already walking up to his car. He saw me in the rear view mirror and sped up a little bit and laughed so I laughed too thinking it was a little joke like “haha I’m gunna leave uuu jk”. I thought he was going to speed up a few feet and stop.. this guy literally goes to the end of the loop where the stop sign is and EXPECTS me to walk clear over there... i was so confused. And it was a little embarrassing bc there were ppl around and he was slowly moving forward and I was fast walking to try and reach his car. But I stopped because I just looked dumb imo. But anyways I told him to do a quick loop around and get me.. He tells me to walk.. I told him to just do a loop around, he refuses and tells me I’m the worst and that he’s about to leave..? He tells me that he was trying to be nice by leaving work early to pick me up yet threatens to leave me because he can’t do a loop around that takes a couple seconds. He admitted that he was annoyed that he had to pick me up and felt like he had to “drop” things which was fair bc he was at work but he’s the one who chose to leave earlier.. I didn’t put that on him. Well anyways, within that couple of seconds of going back and forth he literally takes off and goes back to his place. He said he called me multiple times because he went to go check something out for work but that he was supposedly going to come back to get me.. and because I didn’t pick up he didn’t know where I “went” (I was literally right there the whole time), I just walked back to the waiting area.. so he took that as a cue to leave me stranded..
I couldn’t believe that he left me and then on top of that tried to justify it. Idk, something feels odd about the entire thing. 
He can be a sweetheart sometimes but then a weird, cold person at other times. Like last week he lashed out at me for not having food ready..? Literally lashed out like a child. He’s never done anything like that before, but things like that and little things and then leaving me stranded at school have me thinking.. is this shit people in normal relationships have to put up with? Then he says I’m a sensitive person.. I would argue that he’s not emotionally intelligent enough, and he very rarely recognizes his faults. He deflects and justifies so much. How do you justify leaving me alone at school? You came all the way to pick me up to be “nice” just to fucking leave within a few seconds.. the logic. Please someone pump some sanity back into me bc I feel like I’m being made to feel insane for feeling like something is way off here. And he’s also called me “autistic” knowing full well I hate being called that, and I feel like he’s demeaned me in other ways. Again, he says I’m very sensitive bc he claims it’s a joke. but most people wouldn’t like to be called autistic 3 times a day for a couple days straight.

803,e6busz,Starqueenkiller,1575519732.0,1,I think my friend (21m) took advantage of me (19f) and I am unsure of what to do next,"I’ve been on and off with this guy for a while now. we have some pretty tough history and I Honestly should have just broke it off a while ago, but we reconnected and hit it off regardless. He doesn’t have a girlfriend anymore and so we started to hang out and get flirty again. At first it was nothing serious, he said he wasn’t ready for a relationship yet. But as we hung out more it escalated more and I caught feelings and was very open about it. I should also mention I am a sexual assault survivor and haven’t ventured back out there much. I have a hard time making the first move and just get frustrated because I scare myself. I get major anxiety when it comes to sexual things even if it is with a person I know and trust, and he knows this all as well. 

About a week ago we had a movie night and before he left he kissed me. I thought nothing of it and was excited because I finally thought that it was going to work out, I then received a text an hour later saying how it was merely only a friendly one and that “we” got caught up in the moment even though he initiated it. 

So we hung out another time during the week and nothing explicit happened again, which I was glad that we were able to move past that awkwardness. We then decided to have another movie night (in hindsight I should have realized not the greatest idea) and so we watched two movies while being very close and cuddled on the couch. 

(Nothing too graphic coming up, but just figured I’d give a warning. Also wanted to mention that everything was done consensually!)

After the movies I went to the bathroom and when I came out it was like he had flipped a switch. He was being very suggestive and hansy, which I didn’t mind but in the back of my head I felt something was wrong. I enjoyed the attention, but I was remembering what happened last week and my anxiety in general was kicking in. It got to the point where he wanted me to straddle him and I paced for about 5 minutes because I couldn’t bring myself to do it. My hands and legs were visibly shaking and I really did want to, but my body couldn’t. So after a few minutes I finally did it, but was unable to look him in the eyes or even kiss him. We stayed like that for another few before I was able to just go for it because I really wanted to. It didn’t last long before I realized what I was doing and stopped.

At this point he’s trying to be extra calm to counter act my extreme nerves. He’s commented on my inability to make a move before, but in a teasing way, so he knows that I was really struggling. He suggests we switch places and I agree. So we get off the couch and I can’t even sit down on it. Something in my body is telling me no, and so he asks if I would need help. I say yes and he walks me to it and sits me down, then he climbs on top of me and we start making out. It got heated and hands went places with out being too graphic, and we did that for a while. After some time we stopped and he went to go wash his hands and I was just left there dumbfounded. Like I wanted to do it and enjoyed it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth for some reason. Then then came out and said he had to go home, so I walked him out and he gave me a hug before he left. 

Later like before, I receive similar texts mentioned above. How it was the heat of the moment and we were both in that mood.  And he mentions that he wants to pull it back to friends without benefits, which threw me off because I never agreed to that.

 I just feel odd because he just seemed to really be gunning for that to happen. It seemed as if that was the only reason he came over, and he knew I wouldn’t make a move so he had to do it all himself. I was feeding off the energy he was giving me. Again I’m not accusing him of anything like assault or whatever, but I seems to me that he knew he could do that because I do have feelings for him and wouldn’t want to stop it. 

I would just like some advice as to what I should do now. We’ve hardly talked about it, and now he’s basically ignoring me. I’ve been true to what I was feeling and told him, but he seems to be indifferent about what I say and doesn’t acknowledge that he goaded me into a lot of it. Should I just break it completely off, or try to repair it? As much as I hate to say it, I still have feelings for him even after he pulled this shit, so I don’t want to leave but I feel that may be the best option.

TL;DR Friend knew that he could potentially score due to me developing feelings.

812,e6bqq8,Separate-Choice,1575519157.0,0,I (27M) need some advice on how to handle a FWB (31F) and LDR GF (26) to not hurt anyone,"This is a long one, but I wanted to give the full picture so bear with me guys.

Well here's the thing, I have an LDR relationship almost 2 years now. We don't have any problems and were perfect and happy. Since my LDR GF is working on a 2 year contract, her contract ends at the end of this year, we planned to meet next year and once everything goes well we have plans for me to move to her country and marry her.

Earlier this year while on the job, due to the nature of my job, I had reason to call a victim to render assistance to her and after I helped her she kept my number and messaged me privately on social media to thank me for my help and we began talking just as friends. 

We were talking every few days or so and I told her about my LDR, and she kept pressing me to go out on a date, however since I had my LDR, I kept politely declining. She is a single mother and later I found out she had a bf (he is abusive and an alcoholic) so I kept talking to her because I though she was mature as she stopped asking to date and was also in a relationship where she was not happy and simply wanted friendship to cope. However she started pressing so much for us to date again, I stopped talking to her.

Just about mid this year, she suffered a heart attack, and found out she had a pretty rare heart condition. She messaged me and told me about the problem and it was partly because of stress and family history the condition came on. She told me she had no one else to talk too because no one else listened to her and treat her like I did (I used to carry candy for the kid and junk food for her every week or so, didn't realize how much it meant to her) and she feels comfortable talking to me as I just take her stress away. I felt guilty a little because I felt that if I had kept talking to her, she might not have had as much stress. 

She needs very costly surgery and is on a waiting list to get the surgery. Her condition is fairly bad and she can honestly die at any time as the medication she is using cant really help with the problem, she needs surgery. She asked me to be by her side until she got her surgery and I agreed to give her 24/7 support until she got it. I told my LDR about this and naturally she was not pleased. 

She had to do a test and wanted me to accompany her to the hospital as her bf was drunk and she was not able to get through with him to go with her. I agreed to go with her and after we finished it, we went for coffee in a very nice place near the beach, it was very relaxing and we ended up holding hands and snuggling and just talked about life. The atmosphere was perfect and it was a while since I had experience that with anyone. 

Since that day me and her grew very close, we would talk a lot of hours (6-12 hours+) on the phone daily and she told me about her past and her condition, just a lot of things to keep her mind off the illness. I asked her why she was with her bf, as he gives her a lot of stress but when she explained her past, she was raped twice and abused as a child by a male family member, and had a few abusive relationships, she said its very hard for her to trust men again and she is with him because he earned her trust and it is only after that he became the way he is now. And she said even if she leaves him she is afraid he will hurt her. She has had therapy and stuff for the abuse and rapes, however she doesn't want a restraining order for the bf. She still hasn't gotten over those things. 

So we were just talking and stuff and then one day she needed to go the the doctor and didn't have enough money. It wasn't much to be honest, so I gave her the money and her bf took her. Then she began stressing about her bills and I agreed to help her with it as her bf doesn't live with her and she has a kid and her mom to take care of working minimum wage. I gave her a lot to bring her up to date on her bills and I told my LDR how I am helping her and she got really upset with me and since then I have kept supporting her. 

So I continued to help her financially, gave her emotional support and just be a good friend to her and honestly I had no intention of anything more with her. 

One day while talking she asked me to sleep with her I laughed it off as I though she was joking (the doc advised her to stay away from sex cause of her condition and I have my LDR). She asked a few more times and I declined. One day she went to doc and was really sick, when she came back she told me that if she died I won't have fulfilled her dying wish from me. That statement tore me up and I agreed to be intimate with her. I took her to a very nice place and it was good, however I didn't reach to orgasm, though she did. It's not that it wasn't good, it's just I love my LDR and I was scared cause of her condition. She is also the second person in my life I was intimate with. 

After that we were intimate the night for my birthday cause she asked me to, but it wasn't good at all. She felt distant (later I found out she and her bf spent the daytime together) and I also was feeling guilty cause all I could think of was my LDR and I honestly as scared cause I know how bad her condition is. 

Anyway, two days after that I she and her bf were out drinking, then the next day he was very abusive to her and she had to go to the hospital cause of all the stress from the abuse and the alcohol that she should not be drinking. The doc spoke to her very seriously and she had a wake up call. I told her to really stop going out with him cause it will make her worse and I was upset she has been drinking with him. She was mad at me but got over it and since that they weren't as close. 

In the last few months however, I have begun to feel a bit of jealousy, when they are good or when he is by her on her off days, I will have no contact with her, then when they are not good she would run to me. I used to see them going out sometimes and I felt a little jealous, but I think that jealousy is mainly from the fact that I think in her condition she should stay away from one of her sources of stress. Lately though they have grown very distant and barely talk, I am sure because me and her are in constant communication and I honestly feel guilty cause I know I am partly to blame but I am happy cause it seems she is finally moving on.

I never told my LDR about my intimacy with her, though my LDR and her were having problems because of me being so close to her and she knew me and my LDR were rocky. Me and my LDR are good again, however I didn't tell her because she gets very jealous. I however told her that for the time due to her condition, I don't want any intimacy. 

Lately we have grown to be even closer, and though because of the scars of her past its hard for her to trust anyone, she trusts me and told me she loves me but doesn't know how to say it and honestly, I love her as well. We are currently indirectly in a realtionship, even though she has a bf, though they have been growing further and further apart and I have my LDR. She has been talking about marrying, though the doc says she can't have any more kids because of the stain it will put on her heart even after her surgery. I want to marry my LDR and am in love with her, but lately I have been thinking about the possibility of being with my friend as well. 

The thing is I don't want to disappoint my FWB, I want to be by her side up to the time of the surgery, help her how I can. but I fear we are growing to close and I fell for her. She has a bf and cheat with me, if I take the leap, won't she do the same to me? Her past is rough and she had been though a lot, was previously married, has a kid, had a few partners (less than 10 though) and some of my friends knew her 'party girl' past and try to shame me for it, and she honestly isn't classy. Though I know now she really is changed and is ready to finally settle and move on with her life. Honestly part of me wants to be there for her lifetime, cause I know everything about her life and how far she has come. I accept her past, understand the challenges of her and can work with her, she is someone I can see myself with. 

My LDR is so sweet and I can see myself spending my life with her. She is very career driven, ambitious and we are so compatible, she is my soul mate. She has no kids, never married and also only had 2 partners. I think she matches me closer in terms of decency, intellect and fun and I can see myself with her. I feel terrible for what I did to her. 

I just want a solution to the situation. I want to make everyone happy but I feel trapped. 

If I tell my FWB that I don't want to continue being like this, what if it triggers her and she stresses and her heart acts out? I also like talking to her and want to keep supporting her the way we are, but if it continues we will be leading down a path of someone getting heartbroken and her financial demands are increasing. If I keep supporting her I may not be able to migrate to be with my LDR, but if I choose her she can't make kids and I may want in the future. 

And my LDR I can't bare to think of leaving her. I love her and she is so decent and innocent, she is a good woman. 

What is the best way to deal with this situation?",relationship_advice
813,e6bpzy,notcamilla,1575519066.0,3,Should I be creeped out that my friend (M23) always take/ask for pictures of me (F21)?,"I'm mostly asking to see if someone else asks their friend for pictures like this OR if someone has been in the same situation as me. 

I've known this guy for about 3 years and we've been mostly friends. We've hooked up a couple of times in the past before, but I don't think he sees me as more than a friend (although I've had feelings for him for a while).

I've noticed that he takes a lot of pictures of me when we're hanging out, usually to try and catch me off guard so he can make fun of me. He also frequently texts me pictures from my Instagram and says something like, ""you look so good in this!"", which I've always just seen as him being nice. I've also noticed that he'll often screenshot my Snapchat stories if I post a picture of myself. 

**I'd like to add that all of the pictures I've mentioned are just pictures of my face.** I never post any pictures showing off my body or anything, so all of this seemed really innocent.

I really didn't notice a pattern until a specific moment: he texted me a very old picture of myself from a big iCloud album that was shared with him for another reason. In the picture, you could *kind of* see through my shirt. I had shared the album with him months ago and there were tons of pictures, so he had definitely been looking through it for some reason. He made some comment about how he liked the picture. I told my roommates about this, and they all were really weirded out by the whole situation (understandably). 

I have questioned him on this before, and he dodges the question with a joke. I'm not really sure how else I'd bring it up with him. 

I guess I just want to know what exactly he's getting out of having all these pictures of my FACE. I wasn't at all concerned until my roommates told me that it was definitely creepy. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What's the deal? 

Follow up question: how could I ask him without seeming defensive or creeped out? I'm really just curious.",relationship_advice
814,e6bov3,ThrowRA-198,1575518907.0,1,Adopted daughters abusive mother rocks up,"Me and my partner fostered and then adopted this adorable 3 year old girl, Liliana. She is now a happy 9 year old. A week ago I and my partner had to work late and so she was gonna be picked up by one of her friends parent, who was a little late with the traffic. In that time a woman showed up and said they needed to talk to Liliana about her parents, assuming it was about us she went over to her and listened. Apparently the women explained she was her mother, and clean and wanted to be in her life even giving her some paper with her number and address.

For context, Liliana had abusive parents when she was with them. Her father physically and emtionally abused her, and I suspect he also sexually abused but I'm not sure as I don't feel like pressing for info from her obviously. Both of her parents were addicts, constantly drunk or on drugs, her mother was neglectful, just seeking her own pleasure and ignoring her daughter's pain and abuse. Her parents are wealthy apparently, and she managed to not get a harsh sentence according to the social worker. Sadly, they also hated the father, and so refused to care for their granddaughter, so to foster care she went, from what I've been told.

When Liliana first came around she was so quiet and scared, flinching and apologising, begging not to be sent away, at any sudden movement, it broke my heart watching her. She quickly warmed up to us and me and her become inseparable as I wasn't working at the time. However even as she become happier and came to love us, she had nightmares and overreacted whenever we has to discipline her or were upset for years. She constantly feared that we wouldnt want her and were gonna give her back to her mother. Now she very rarely overreacts that way or thinks anything like that to my knowledge. And aside from her being a little too clingy she's no different from the other girls her age now that she's older.

On seeing her the woman (Her mum), she apparently kinda shut down, acting subdued and quiet I was told. When I talked how her she started crying thinking I had suddenly betrayed her and tried to get rid of her. I don't think I'll ever forget her tears as she begged me not to leave her, that she though I loved my little Lili (My nickname for her). It wasn't true, i could never do that, but it cut my heart as I comforted her. 

My partner was adopted and never knew either of the biological parents, and so thinks that we have to let Liliana see her mother and have a relationship, especially since she's now clean and wants to be there. We have talked to the social worker and they've said that she has passed all the programs and the CCO and apparently has over the last 3 years expressed interest in her daughter. The problem is I remember all Liliana's nightmares and crying and her obviously traumatised self. And every person I've seen who comes into my life saying, ""I'm clean now it's ok"" has relapsed hard. 

Maybe im biased, but I don't want her near my daughter and over the last week it's caused me and my partner to fight. Liliana doesn't know about the fighting, and hasn't said anything about whether she wants to see her, just that she doesn't wanna leave us. She would be willing to see her if we asked, knowing her, but I doubt she would be upset if we didn't. I don't know what to do, I feel bad for her mother to an extent, but not enough to feel comfortable having her near Liliana. How should I proceed with this?",relationship_advice

This is the first time I'm consulting Reddit for advice because I'm genuinely clueless about whom I should ask for advice from. Please forgive me if I miss out explaining anything.

Yes, the title mostly explains it, but not entirely. I've been witnessing my mom being harassed physically and verbally since a very small age (I'm 20 now). It was more of physical abuse earlier, now it is verbal swearing on a daily basis.

My father is a regular drinker. He drinks and changes into a different person— basically he sane anymore. One time, my mom was on her periods. Somehow the blood left a stain on the bedsheet and somehow he found it out. Next thing I knew, he was chasing her with the TV remote and eventually threw it at her twice before I intervened.

Last night, my mom served him food (he drank before that). He felt that the fish was too salty, so he started cursing her, saying things about her sister, her mother (my aunt and grandma respectively), about how ""their culture"" is filthy and all sorts of things.

Another fact, I don't remember this very clearly, nor do I come up with this topic in front of any of my family members, but perhaps my father had an affair with another woman (I don't remember this because I was very small and I've a memory problem).

I'm hoping she divorces him, and today she came to me and asked if I would mind if she does. I said I don't. But she and I, both are clueless as to what should we do now?

Something happened a few years back then and I decided that I wanted to cut him off, but we walked into each other early this year and became friends again.

Last month he told me there’s a new girl who just joined his workplace and talked about how she is part of this group (the detail is not relevant but basically before she joined his company she was doing volunteer work for her friend in this group), and how he found her really interesting. We had lunch together today (we normally meet up for lunch 1-2 time per month) and he told me he’d be having lunch with her tomorrow, which he is excited about. Which I thought was great! Although he mentioned she already has a boyfriend.

Everything else were fine until later this evening we had the following conversation (via messages)

David *“I have no confidence for tomorrow lunch now lol”*

Me *“huh why’s that?”*

David *“Lack of interest now, you kept saying meh to everything that happens with the chick”*

Me *“what…. How’s that related to your lack of confidence”*

David *“Decrease in interest leads of lack of motivation, and hence my confidence level drop as a consequence”*

Me *“your interest in her shouldn’t be affected by my opinion”*

David *“I have this exact sentence in mind too, but easier said than done, ahhhhhhh”*

And the conversation kind of ended like that as I have no idea what else to say. 

I looked back at some older messages and noticed that maybe I have acted a little cold when he talks about the new girl. I didn’t just reply him “meh” but the topic usually changed to something else quickly and he mentioned before that *“the conversation shouldn’t be going like this, you are supposed to ask me info about the new chick”*    
However, it is completely unintentional, I am just generally not really interested in people unless they have some specific traits or have something in common (i.e. watch Mr. Pickles).

I am just really confused now and keep thinking whether I should have been more supportive when he talks about the girl. I don't know what to do / how to reply him now.",relationship_advice

&#x200B;

My dad has these very occasional fits of extreme anger; I'm not really sure what causes them. Once he got super triggered because I was crying, and once because I didn't get up for dinner. But whatever I do wrong apparently aggravates him a lot, because he gets pissed as fuck and tries to punch me and choke me out. This has happened a few times, starting around my senior year of hs.

For some background, I had some issues with my parents in high school (I'm now a college sophomore), but that was really more of my fault, and they were very patient with me. And my relationship with my dad is great 99.9% of the time. We go shopping together, cook, etc. and we're very affectionate. It's just that once in a while, he gets so angry that I feel like he's a totally different person.

We haven't talked about it & I'm not sure it would be productive even if I tried. He usually just pretends it doesn't happen afterward, or asks to watch Tv together, or something, and I go with it. Sometimes I feel like I just imagined the incidents, since he's so chill the rest of the time. I thought it might be because of alcohol, but he drinks every day and doesn't blow his shit then.

What should I do? I don't want to report him, since I love my parents and have a good relationship with both of them. But I don't want to get hit again either. I considered family therapy, but I'm pretty sure my dad would not consent to that. And I don't even know how or if I should broach the topic. Any advice appreciated.",relationship_advice

Here goes... so basically we were at this party, and we were having a good time. I was sitting on the couch and I must admit that I’m a few drinks in and I’m feeling a bit tipsy. And she doesn’t drink. Like at all. 

Her friends were just kind of feeding her alcohol, and after a few mins she wasn’t being herself and was saying all of this weird shit to me. Then she drank some more (after I insisted that she didn’t) and then went crazy. I told her that she needed to calm down and she wouldn’t 

Her friends took her into a bedroom to calm down and she just started crying. I didn’t know this at first but when I walked in there about five minutes after to check on her she just started yelling that it was my fault and that I ruined her night. 

I felt really bad because I knew this wasn’t normal but every time I walked into that room to check in she just kept throwing insults at me and sobbing.

We would hang out so much through out the years it was like me family and was very nice to have a sort of second home 

Towards the mid of 11th grade B came out to me since we were so close. I had lots of gay family members so It didn’t really effect me

I would notice B getting kind of touchy with me but would brush it off 

B soon began to transition into a female during senior year and we started to drift apart as graduation came closer

During summer I moved across town and didn’t see B for almost 4 to 6 months BTW (ALOT CAN CHANGE IN MONTHS)

B was a whole new person. We ended up getting jobs in this mall in our city and got close again.

Anyways it’s been 3 days since I permanently cut myself away from him and all of a sudden, I get a Snapchat from him. (I deleted him off my friends list but I guess he didn’t do same). I opened it a day later and he sent me a random snap like everything is okay. So I texted him letting him know that I meant it when I told him I can’t be friends and I need some time to decide if I even want to be friends down the road or not and then he replied with “let me know if you want to meet up to talk”🙄🙄.yeah I left him on read.

Ps. Basically when I had left for those 5 months, he became mad at me. He didn’t tell me exactly because he is one of those who for the love of God cannot express their emotions - but I figured. He was rude to me sometimes while I away for awhile before he stopped and started to act flirty and all in like with me again. “I miss you I’m a man I’ll admit that” ugh🙄🙄...

I believe his feelings are in the middle. He tried so hard to get over me by taking up so much hobbies (a friend of his told me this). He said after I left he lost feelings for me and I want to believe that cuz when guys say that usually they mean it but OMG I gave him a way out why won’t he take it and leave me alone?? Advice pls!!

Pls don’t say block him. Obviously I know that but I’m also curious.",relationship_advice
836,e6beju,moanaa_33,1575517506.0,1,Am I a terrible friend for this ???,"need friend advice....

I had this friend who I’ve known for years....   (sorry it might me long) 

we hung out with these 2 guys...but I noticed my friends crush (thing1) would have more of a conversation with me. This guy seemed like he was more interested in getting to know me to even complementing me on how pretty I would look right infront of my friend and his.

Long story short my friend and thing1 were talking since he had to in order to be close to me since he started everything off on the wrong foot and didn’t know how to tell me his feelings bc he thought I was still talking to his friend..this resulted in my friend really doing whatever she could to get him to notice her, but I wasn’t 100% sure at the time that this guy thing1 had a real crush on me... more than him being nice and complimenting me sometimes. he just seemed like a really nice friend and we had a lot in common. But yet he wasn’t all that innocent he at times would lead her on & any little thing he would do my friend would get the wrong signals and hope of something which was never there. So this must have all been less than 2months when my friend was still trying sooo hard for him to take the next step in really dating and being official.. but this guy just felt so much pressure and kept telling her he didn’t really feel the same until one day he really went off and let her know it was going to be nothing and I can’t remember at that time what he might have said but time went by like couples months and we connected again and he finally tells me he really liked me and wanted to see where it went. I was conflicted because I had gotten to know him during the time we were all friends and I thought he was really nice and again we had a lot in common. 

I didn’t know how to tell my friend because she literally had become obsessed with this guy it seemed like she really insisted and wanted this guy so bad and I just knew it would hurt her, but at the same time I felt like she knew deep down that he didn’t want her and she was still chasing him around and got her hopes up for nothing when all the signs were there and she didn’t care.

Me and my friend go out to eat one day and she starts telling me how she always felt like this guy thing 1 really liked me and wanted to know me. I told her that I thought that as well but I wasn’t so sure because maybe he was just being nice ..by the time thing 1 confessed to me his feelings I later decided to have a serious convo with her and let her know what thing 1 told me...I never had a guy really Persue me and take so much interest in me he let me know how bad he felt about my friend and he even apologized to her and wanted to move forward. 

My friend ofcourse made it a huge deal I told her I was torn between wanting to see where it goes with this guy, yet hurting her because I knew she liked him. but I told her that she knows me best and knows I would never purposely try to hurt her in any way and even tho that happened with that guy she knows my heart and knows what I’ve been through I finally meet this guy and because of the terrible circumstances I feel bad it ever happened that way and i would never do such a thing unless I was 100% he was serious about me.. next thing you know we give it a try and 2years later we are still together doing amazing and seeing a future together. 

so moving forward I thought we would pull through from it but her anger and grudge only grew bigger despite of her now dating his cousin she holds this grudge and jealousy over me talking about me behind my back and trying to humiliate me. She’s now within my bfs family since she’s dating the cousin.

Im in such a bad situation with her because of all the drama she’s caused in between for so long I felt terrible because of how it happened and now I’m just exhausted of looking like the bad guy even tho I feel like I did all I could as a friend to speak up and let her know what was going on and trying to be an adult about it. But she stayed being so immature and getting her family involved.

I don’t know what to do to fix this or move on from this even after talking to her several times ! ...Was I a terrible friend for this ?",relationship_advice
837,e6bdxs,ThrowRAwdid,1575517428.0,2,My (28f) boyfriend (28m) has a overly attached mother and he fears her too much,"My boyfriend is the only child and comes from a very, very fortunate family. I come from a very average family and has had a rocky life. His mom had him in her later years and had a hard time conceiving which is why I understand her level of protection and love for him. 

My boyfriend and I are getting serious and talking about marriage and I love him deeply (I would say he is the love of my life) and vice versa. However, his mom is so overly protective and it is causing me to think twice about the relationship.

**Mom:**

She has openly said that she wants him to live in with her after marriage and then, very passive-aggressively then said that she will buy him an apartment in the same building as ""he will want to live his own life without me"". She has taken action to do this - she is looking to buy an apartment already. However, the apartment will still be under her name and I am uncomfortable with this. I want an apartment one day with mine and his name but we won't be able to afford it. We have cheaper options out there but she has clearly said that she does not want him to live in a cheap apartment. 

She also does not like it when he is away on occasions and I mean - his birthday, christmas, new years etc etc. I am unable to spend time with him on his birthday without her, including both lunch and dinner.  

At his age, he still has to ""ask for permission"" to travel and she still probes into his room. He can't go out late and she would wait up for him until he comes home which puts a lot of pressure on us going out. 

**Boyfriend:**

He does not ever disagree with her and even when we have planned a day out or planned to go have lunch together, once his mom says that she wants to have lunch with us (him actually), he doesn't even preempts me and we end up having lunch together. Note: I would say this is every weekend (both lunch and dinner) and 50% of weekday dinners.

He does have his own opinions but he never voices it out - he tells me that he agrees to disagree. 

He feels very pressured by his mother's expectations and her constant ""attachment"" but he would never tell her because he thinks it would break her. 

**Me:** 

I love him and by extension, his family. His mother is a sweetheart and she is nice to me. However, it has come to a point where I feel like I am dating him AND his mother and we hardly have any private time together. I have spoken to him about this before (very carefully as I did not want to stress him out further), I told him that I feel that a line has to be drawn one day and it is not up to me or his mother to draw that line, it is him that has to do it but I don't trust that he will based on current situation.  He told me that he knows one day he will have something he truly cares about and will finally disagree openly with her. It's just that whatever he ""agrees to disagree"" with her are issues that he feels are trivial and does not want to start a fight because he literally has never fought with her before. 

I love my mother greatly and I will care for her into her old age and of course, I expect him to do the same to his mother and I will also care for his mother. However, it is the expectation ""I gave you life and you owe me"" that I really dislike. 

I am really stressed out by this situation and I don't want to marry him only to be undermined by his mother. 

I am not prepare to have a life with him until he mans up but I don't trust that he will despite what he says. I don't know if I should end things and just move on or wait and see if he ever does. I love him so much that it hurts just thinking about leaving him but I don't want to live my life being second to her waiting for my boyfriend to one day put his words into action. What do I do?

I honestly don’t know. It just made me feel like an ogre.

He takes HOURS to reply to my messages these days and when I ask where he was, he would say he was ""reading"" (for over 8 hours), or that there was disruption in wifi, or something. I approached him recently about his changing behaviour and had asked him if he wanted a break. He got very upset at me. I should also state too, that many times in the past I would show him where he would have wronged me and he would get upset at me again, show me how much I was being irrational and then I would end up being the one apologizing and trying to mend things every time.

He didn't even wanna look for one til I told him I won't be with him if he doesn't have one by February. He's notorious for not going in when he has a job and getting fired a lot for it. I hate having to support him and myself because I can barely do it. He thinks I can afford Christmas presents for my family him AND his (two) sisters and  has spent my money without my knowledge beforehand before.

He just recently started looking for a job has had pretty good luck so far. But we also have a lot of other problems such as him not wanting to clean up after himself and shower. He won't shower for days and then expect some action from me. Even when I tell him no he persists. He won't take a shower unless I promise him some or he has to be presentable for something. 

We fight almost every day. Sometimes about small things and others being important like money and food. I really don't wanna be with him anymore. He's too dirty and lazy, but I'm not a complete asshole. If I were to dump him he'd be homeless, phoneless, and carless. I really don't want to wait til February also because I don't want him to move with me to the new apartment with roommate.(when we will be put on the lease)

we haven’t talked in over 2 months and i have no desire to. but, i guess he sold the car i gave him when we were together cause it broke down and he then got a loan to pay off his new car and i guess he needed to put someone down as an emergency contact for the loan or something like that and he texted my mom and asked if she could be the emergency contact for this
thing.

my mom ended up calling him and they talked for a while about my family, me, my brother, etc. i guess he told my mom that he misses us aka my family and everything. 

he just said “oh good good,” when my mom said i was doing good in school, going out with friends etc. 

but anyways, why does he feel the need to use my mom as that emergency contact? couldn’t he have used his sister, mom, cousin, or even his girlfriend (the girl he cheated on me with) or her family ? is he trying to keep contact with me somehow? or what could the reason possibly be?

849,e6b8bw,smallltowngirl,1575516687.0,2,Starting to worry about how much I love being with my boyfriend. How do I stop wanting to see him so much?,"Hi guys, 20F here. So my boyfriend 20M and I have been dating for a few months, but I’ve known him for years. I know that I do know him fully, as we grew up together and he is naturally a transparent and straightforward, simple guy. 

I love him very much, and he loves me very much. He treats me like an angel and honestly, I couldn’t ask for it to be any better. He’s honest, comforting, authentic, hilarious, energetic yet laid back, he doesn’t stress heavily yet he keeps busy, he’s gentle, kind, and we bust each other’s balls all the time. He was been all about me even before I started showing an interest in him. He makes me feel loved and accepted. He hasn’t let me down yet at all, and our communication skills are great. He goes to school in our town so he is local. Compared to my last relationship which was about 2 years, this is already just so much better. When we are together it’s just wholesome and so much fun. He never wants to leave, and he’s always the one to ask to hangout, yet he has good balance in his life so I’m sure he doesn’t feel guilty about seeing me often because he has a lot he does on a regular basis. 

A little bit about myself that is important for this specific question: I was a university student at a university in my town. Great school. However, I have taken this semester off due to my anxiety being very bad. I couldn’t focus on my work because of my mental health being in poor condition. I have had anxiety all my life but it was not this rough until the past 2 or 3 months. Since September I’d say. So I am not in school. It worries me because I already don’t like school to begin with and I have to figure out what I’m switching my major to when I go back next year. My boyfriend has been very supportive through this all. 

I also don’t have a job bc of the anxiety. I am in therapy, which has been helping. But to top off the fact that I feel like a bit of a bum even though I know I have potential and a good home life and I don’t engage in bad habits such as drugs etc., I don’t have a lot of friends right now. 

Since I didn’t dorm at my school because I live so close, I feel like that made a lot of the difference. I wasn’t dating my boyfriend last year at this time though. 

I often do feel lonely, even though I have people to talk to. My best friend goes to school a few hours a way, my other very close friend is who I go out with at school with a group of girls. I am not close w those girls but I am comfortable when I’m with them. 

I really need more friends and feel like I can’t do it until I’m in school. 

So basically, I’m not in school. I don’t have a job but I know I need one because all I do is basically just sit at home or hangout with my boyfriend. I worry that maybe I enjoy him so much because I don’t have many friends or other things going on. I am very careful not to lose myself in him. I think about this often. I don’t think I’d love him any less if I had more friends, but I do think I would obviously be busier and not think about the next time I’ll see him as much. 

I need to become busier. I need to make more girl friends but kind of have forgotten how over the years. I’m not a recluse, I go out and I’m known as pretty and “relevant”, although I don’t feel it but yanno. I also know a lot of people but just don’t know how to be friends with them without telling them I’m not in school this year bc of anxiety. 

I’m just worried and feel like I need to start doing more and soon. Sitting around overthinking about every little thing is killing me. I basically only hangout with my boyfriend, sister, my close friend, my best friend when she comes in, and my other friends every now and then. 

I’m panicking because I don’t want to go downhill while I’m trying to get better. Being alone sometimes makes me feel depressed because I feel like I don’t have many friends and I’m doing nothing. 

I like to do things. I like knowing I have people. I hate sitting around thinking about when I’ll see him, or what the hell I’ll do tomorrow because this semester has been so god damn boring.",relationship_advice
850,e6b7dc,Sg-Lg,1575516557.0,1,My husband (35) calls me (35) names,"Hi, sorry if my English is not correct (not a native speaker).

I have been married to my husband for 8 years. He is a wonderful person usually.  He is a hard worker, he doesn't restrict my actions, and supports my choices. We get on really well. But whenever we have arguments, he calls me bitch, moron, idiot, etc, which upset me.

Problem happened last night, after a busy day for both of us (we both work full time).  
I sat down on the couch. He was already there drinking whisky.   
I said ""I want to book a ticket (for an upcoming event) for mum"". He looked at me, but said nothing.   
I started searching for the tickets online. He turned the TV on, and started talking to me about the show.  
I was preoccupied, and said ""ah, really"". And he shrugged his shoulder and said ""you ignore me"".  
I said ""Sorry"", but realized that he actually didn't say a word when I told him about tickets.  
That's when I felt annoyed and asked ""Why is it OK for you to ignore me?  You get upset when I ignore you.""  
He said lately he has trouble hearing. That's something I have never heard from him.  
I said ""I didn't know. why don't you go see a doctor? I think you should have asked me to repeat, if you didn't hear me.""

That was it, after that it was just name calling (fucking bitch, stupid, etc...) and he left to bedroom. I felt hurt and angry, I went to his room and yelled at him ""Why do you call me bitch!!""   
He asked me to leave, still swearing. But I was too frustrated to leave. He pushed me, I resisted. But in the end, he picked me up and throw me out of the room. I hit my head and my elbow. That physical abuse is partially my fault... I followed him around, when he probably was trying to calm down. Still I just can't stay quiet when he calls me names.

This is not a first occasion. Last night our daughter was asleep, but she has heard those words too in the past. We make it up every time, but he actually never apologized for name calling. He never understands that it hurts me. What should I do to make him stop?",relationship_advice
851,e6b6gg,coffeequirky,1575516442.0,1,Would it ever be okay to reach out to my ex-gf again?,"So, my ex & I dated for almost 3 years. (Started in high school, went through part of college.) It was my first serious relationship, and despite both of us being unreasonable teenagers at times, it was overall a really great relationship and a time I will always treasure. 

We broke up about 6 months ago, because I was moving across the country for career opportunities & we realized we would never be able to live in the same place together because of the careers we both want. It was super hard to go through, but now I can confidently say i’m over the relationship. But, I still wish that she and I could be on good terms and maybe talk every once in a while.

After the initial break up, we texted a couple times, and met up once in person so i could give her back some of her stuff. We had some good conversation, and it was really nice catching up with her. However, about 3 months ago, I saw on social media that she had a new boyfriend. It was of course not super fun seeing her with another guy, but I was happy for her and only want the best for her. But out of nowhere, she deleted me off of all social media (she didn’t block me, but made her accounts private & unfollowed me, so I can’t see anything she posts anymore.) This hurt, especially since the last thing she said when we broke up was “I don’t want you to disappear, I want us to still be close.” I know she has no obligation to stay in contact with me, but part of me would at least like some closure about why she cut me off like that. I wonder if it was just because of her new bf, or if she was resentful of me over something.

Anyway, i’m considering maybe texting her on christmas, just to say merry christmas & that I hope everything is going well for her. Do you all think this would be inappropriate to do? I of course don’t want to make her uncomfortable, I just want to let her know I still care about her & wish we could be on good terms still.

&#x200B;

I (16F sophomore) met this guy (16M junior) and we just started talking last month. I thought things were going great because we were both flirting, until I confessed and he told me he was unsure (he got into a relationship too quickly and became hurt over it in the past).

Things are going okay, but he's sending dry responses (as he's done before, but it seems even drier now). It's primarily one sided when it comes to conversations, but I want him to open up to me somehow. I like to believe that I'm a very straightforward person who'll say what's on my mind (sparked the whole confession), but I have no clue how to feel about this situation.

If I truly like him, it must be plausible to believe that I should continue to pursue him, right? However, I have no clue if I'll lose feelings for him within that time period (selfish I know, but I currently would give my everything for him if he asked). 

Overall, I'm asking whether or not I should pursue this confusing relationship with him or leave him as my friend so that we both won't be hurt at the inevitable end of the relationship.",relationship_advice

I made my future goals known and was as real as could be with going abroad to teach English for about 3 years after I graduated. I also made my intention for a life together as real as possible (marriage/family etc.) He understood. Now I have graduated and have been away for 4 months but it has been a real struggle in our relationship. He wants to support me but he doesnt want me to be so far away. For reasons, he cant leave the country so he cant come and visit. I am trying to be as supportive as possible when we talk and text reasuring him that ill return after a few years, but also that I will visit in the summer. I have sent him postcards and a package and intend to continue doing so but I have not received anything. He is seriously struggling with his depression and I understand that but I dont know what else to say. He quit school and spends a lot of time shut in, going out to work and occasionally doing things with friends and family or going to the gym. I try to motivate him but its hard. Now he is saying that he doesnt want to be better. Ive tried encouraging him to spend more time with people, pick up hobbies, write to me, go to the gym, see a therapist, but not much has changed. I dont want to him to keep hurting but I also cant go back now.Has anyone had a similar experience? Can anyone offer some advice towards my situation?",relationship_advice
856,e6b4lu,zaxdsf99,1575516205.0,1,My GF (25f) I (29m) is driving me crazy!,"Some background; We are in a LDR, been dating for almost 3 years now. We talk everyday and only seen each other once. Before and during our 1st year of dating I was in a bad place and she helped me a lot which I’m super thankful for. But during that time I was a different person and said things at the time I wanted or liked, which I no longer do. For an example, having children. A lot of stuff I don’t remember saying but she keep all our texts and loves to show me them. Please keep in mind I was in a dark place. So I’ve told her that I’ve changed my mind on a lot of things but she doesn’t want to except it. So most of the time when we talk we just argue and argue. I’m the person that likes to step away and think about stuff, wait until things calm down, she isn’t. It’s coming to the point where I’m just sick of the fighting along with her neediness and jealousy of everyone and everything in my life, which isn’t much. She constantly brings up my ex to tell me how I did this and that with her, thinking I loved my ex more. Bringing up how she doesn’t like certain family members of mine and if I’m with them blows up. Telling me I’m not romantic enough with her, which I try to please her all the time and do what she wants more but it isn’t enough. Lately it’s getting to the point were I can’t stand talking to her. She makes things so miserable. I’m not one to go and start arguments but not In her case. We will be having a good time when all of a sudden she is pissed at something I did in the past, future or present. Which is normally me teasing or making a joke that sets her off then its on and she goes off about everything. As I said I don’t want kids due to how the world is becoming and tbh I don’t want to be responsible for kids. But she’s always forcing it down my throat along with getting married and how next time I see her I better propose and have a ring. She’s always telling/hinting at marriage which tbh I’m not ready for do to personal reasons. But that still doesn’t stop her from always being on my case. Then comes her neediness, she won’t give me my space even when we’re in a LDR, we always have to talk most of the day which I don’t mind until we start arguing then I hate it. She’ll start crying if I’m away with someone else or by myself cause she thinks I care more about them or don’t want to talk, which isn’t the case. If I’m busy I’m busy. She also thinks I’m going to abandon her and thinks I don’t love her. It’s just becoming mentally draining and I’m afraid of breaking up with her cause she’s threaten to do something stupid like hurting/killing herself. Which I don’t want to happen ever! I feel trapped. Don’t get me wrong I love her with all my heart, I just don’t like the drama, arguing, jealousy and being told I better propose to her. Idk what to do or how I can fix our relationship. 

Also I know I’m far from perfect, I know I said that I wanted things then have changed me mind, I can come off as distant at times. I don’t want you think I’m sort of saint cause I’m not nor is anyone.",relationship_advice

I will make known my current situation in my relationship before getting to the details. Sincerely thanks in advance to everyone for taking the time to read and respond.

It's almost 3 months now since things changed. My ex?-gf and I had a really bad quarrel over an incident whereby she contacted her ex before me and a friend of his which led me to losing it all and then calling her a ""cheap bitch"". She was very hurt and cried etc then we agreed to give each other time to cool down before reconciling. But then when it was finally time (7 - 10 days later), she told me she has got someone new she loves. I crumbled ... I could not even know what to feel ... I was just in despair and lost ...

I asked why and how ... she said she feels this new love of hers made up for all my shortcomings and reciprocates whatever efforts she puts in almost immediately if not immediately ... Put it this way - whatever she puts into the relationship with me, her returns comes in bits by bits from a whole while whatever she puts into the relationship with the new love, her returns comes by the whole and he has got much more to offer than me.

I accepted this and admitted defeat ... then I went on a 2 weeks solo vacation to sort of heal. I did not contact her after I left and neither did she until 2 days after I returned from my vacation. She asked to meet up and tells me she still loves me but is afraid and unsure and also because she also loves the other person. At this point we agreed on a date whereby she will make clear her feelings by. Realistically speaking, she can only have one. You can't love two person. At least not to me.

Anyway, the date came and she still could not make a decision, hence I decided to be the one to leave. I had already decided to do this should this scenario happened. Immediately the next day she came looking for me again. I honestly thought I would stick firm to my decision but no ...

As of right now as I am typing this, this is our situation - she claims she loves me but is unsure of I really don't know what. She don't even want to tell me and her new found love is still around. She talks to me about this new found love and all like when they are gonna go public in real life and social media etc and hence I decided to remove all my social media postings with her which I had not done so previously. But then she got mad by what I did. She says we are not in a relationship but we are in a relationship. Like there is no distinct line. I still have not done things that like ""break rules in our relationship"" , namely things she does not like but she is doing things I do not like and still telling me she loves me and all...

Let's talk about me - I really am not sure if I should attempt to even try again with her or not. I admit I still have feelings for her, but really at the same time I am very pissed off with her by whatever she is doing. More importantly is that I am unable to give myself a clear direction ahead.

What are we? What is going on? What do I do?

PS: Im really sorry if it is a messy write up. I need help but I can't express properly. I really am also not trolling because I feel like what I typed might come across as trolling. I really need directions. Its taking a toll on me.",relationship_advice
860,e6b0u6,TallestHamAround,1575515709.0,2,A kissing question,"For context, my girlfriend (18f) and I (19m) have been together for just short of two months. Over the past week or two, we've both started to get past our discomfort with physical contact, hugging and cuddling frequently, even falling asleep together. We are very open with each other and communicate very well, and we're both happy with the pace we're at.
With that in mind, I'm assuming it's only a matter of time before we share a kiss, which would be a first for both of us.
The question then, is, should I ask her what her feelings are regarding kissing, or should I instead wait for that 'movie moment' where we both know we're at that point? I'd assume to take the former option in light of our strong communication, but I've yet to find a way to word the question that comes natural.

I haven't really gotten too close with this girl (29F)(Let's call her M) , but we've hung out a bit outside program (tho it's almost always with another volunteer buddy, let's call him John(25M)) i don't know a lot about her but for some reason John knows quite a bit about M, even tho I don't see them talk that much at volunteer. 

I don't mean to peek, but whenever John opens his messages (he drives me home after program and uses his phone GPS everytime), he has a bunch of texts with M while I've barely even texted her. And I think i saw a group chat with M and a bunch of names I don't know. You might think it's different people with same name, but trust me, she has a unique name that rarely anyone else would have the exact same name. 

Whenever we do hang out, it seems like John is much closer to M and it appears she enjoys his company. She's a bit older so she might not even see me as a potential dating partner. And whenever we are together, I'm usually the one talking and it's usually about my shitty childhood. 

Should I even bother asking M on a date? Is she better off with John? From what I've gathered, John is clearly the better choice. He beats me in every aspect. He's always positive, enjoyable to be around, great personality, attractive, smart, traveled, etc.. Like there's nothing I beat him in. Wouldn't she be better off with him? And he might have feelings for her too. I'm pretty sure he does but he won't admit it. 

I want her to be happy. I'm mentally dead, I hate life and everything. I don't want to burden her with my worthless self. What's the best option here? Ship her with John?",relationship_advice

865,e6azgc,ThrowRAmoveout,1575515530.0,2,Breaking up with fiancé but have no money of my own as I quit my career to help grow his company.,"Not sure if this is the right sub for this... I have been together with my (F27) fiancé (M32)  for almost 5 years and living together for 3. We just got engaged a few months ago. When we got engaged I was on the verge of breaking up with him. I always hear that people think those milestones (moving in, getting engaged, married, baby, etc) will fix things and they never do. Well it’s true. I am close to wanting to call off the engagement and move out.

My question though is less about the relationship and more about how to go about the breakup as I feel I am in a very vulnerable situation. I quit my full time job over a year ago to help him with his business. So I don’t get paid or make any of my own money but he pays my expenses/I have access to his bank and credit cards. So basically I have no savings or money of my own. I do not have family that I can fall back on. Another problem is that my car doesn’t pass emissions so I wouldn’t be able to take it if I moved (our county is exempt but I would have to move to the city to get a job). Everything we have is together. Insurance, cell phones, dogs, etc. I’m just feeling so overwhelmed, but I don’t want fear of leaving to be the deciding factor in committing to this person for the rest of my life.

I guess my question is what rights do I have? I have nothing. I’ve been working for him to grow his business and if I leave he has benefitted from my work but I never got a paycheck... If I leave I want a clean break and to move as fast as possible, but how do I do that with no money or car? I would just want a fresh start and be able to get back on my feet. I do live in the US if that makes a difference.

Sorry this post is a bit scatterbrained, I get pretty emotional just thinking about it.

Okay so, backstory. I'm 17 and female. I go to car meets a lot in my area, which is where people show up with nice cars and cruise, do burnouts, swing their cars, etc. I met a guy there who was talking about selling coke (lets call him B), so I jokingly was like ""let me get a line!"" because that's just my personality, I'm vulgar and out of pocket. This struck up a conversation, and we became friends. Later, someone else at the car meet told him that the week before this specific meet, he got a little angry because B was bragging about his money. I'm not gonna lie, I love money, so this was interesting to me. Him and I started talking about how he got it. He told me how he's 20 and owns three businesses. I jokingly said to him ""I'll be your sugar baby"" and he was like ""okay cool"" and I was kind of shook that he was serious, but we spent the rest of the night hanging out at the meet and then exchanged information. That night when I got home, I looked him up, found his full name, his Facebook, and his business on the secretary of state website.

We started texting a little and went out to the car meet the next week, then hung out the day after and got food. He told me about how he graduated at 15 with a 4.4 GPA, got emancipated, and moved to Montana and went to college at 16 (which I already knew, I saw it on his Facebook from years back). So I was like, okay, I did my research, he's telling me stuff he didn't even know I knew, so he's honest. We had some deep conversations, and we pretty much have the same mindset. Him and I are just on the same level about pretty much everything. We both are focused on long-term things, like careers, money, etc. We have the same interests, like we both want to travel and deepen our knowledge of other cultures, and we love cars, and we watch the same people on YouTube. 

Anyway, so we continued texting and hung out yesterday and today. It's been like two months since we first met at a car meet, but we never really started talking until two weeks ago. Yesterday we went to the mall, and he bought me a sweater and bought himself some things, then we went to KFC. After that we sat in the parking lot just talking. He told me he's interested in me as a girlfriend because I'm focused, smart, and eye candy. I was excited when he told me this, because I like him too. He was saying he wanted to take me to Europe, because he knows how badly I want to go. He then started telling me stories of things he's done and how he's gotten where he is, showed me how he started up his business, like all the documents and PDFs and all that bull. How he has a double minor in mechanical engineering, and also studied psychology and business. He told me owns a car dealership and two logistics companies. And then he offered me a job. I already work at Pizza Hut, making minimum wage, maybe a little more than $100 a week. He told me he makes about $400k a year, and is projecting to be a millionaire in two years. He told me all I'd be doing is paperwork, like filling out w-9 forms, and also making phone calls for loads and negotiating prices. He also said my weekly pay would be $500, which is a LOT to me. 

We hung out today and didn't do much except just sit in my room and watch movies. I told my mom about the job offer, and she started warning me about this kind of situation, and now I've just been sitting here completely freaking myself out, and I don't know if how I'm feeling is valid or not. The thing I am most worried about is that the loads he's transporting could be drugs or guns, internationally. Or even worse, human trafficking. Not to toot my own horn, but I am pretty, but I'm also smart. I don't want to be completely naive going into this. Here are my points, sorry about the format.

On the good side:

\-he's truthful (from what I know so far)

\-seen evidence of college and businesses

\-I have his full name and he's met my mom

On the bad side:

\-started talking to him because he was talking about getting coke from Mexico

\-making almost half a million a year at 20

\-three years older than me

\-buying me things I want

\-incredibly smart and has a way with words, gets his way (the kind of traits you see in serial killers)

\-offering me a high paying, easy job

\-offering to take me around the world with him

\-moving fast with me in terms of relationship

The thing is, most of the bad things are explainable. Have I hit the jackpot or am I stupid? What initially attracted me to him was the money, because I just thought it would be a kind of business relationship, but now that we've gotten to know each other, I kind of like him, and now that my mom has brought up the danger, it's making me scared of how I feel. I always go with my gut because it's always been right, but could this be the time it's wrong? Am I just worrying too much?

I could just be extremely lucky and have found a great guy who I could have a perfect life with, or I could be putting myself in a dangerous situation. I just don't know and need a little guidance right now. Am I freaking out? How should I move forward? What are tricks traffickers use? What kinds of people do they target?

I am in love with my best friend who also happens to be my ex. We live together in the same bedroom, which makes moving on difficult but honestly I’m not looking to move on. We have discussed getting a new place together as well, even moving to other states and countries. We’re truly best friends.

Most days we are a couple in everything but name. Holding hands while sleeping or when we’re going out for dinner. Regular sex and lots of laughter. I feel the only differences are that we don’t say “I love you” in romantic situations (we do say it in friendly situations, or when comforting each other), aaaand that he’s actively on dating websites and apps talking to other women. Most of them are in different countries, but that doesn’t mean I don’t take this seriously. We’ve both been in long distance relationships, so I’m very aware he may be looking for something real.

Not long ago we had a talk where he admitted he was having a wonderful time with me, but didn’t want me to go crazy with that statement and blow it out of proportion. He followed up with his suspicions that he’s polyamorous.

My greatest fear with polyamory is that if my partner were to find someone else, it means I am being replaced. But I’ve come to understand (with hasty research and talks with some friends) that polyamory isn’t about replacing people or having people be interchangeable.

And I wonder if I can make that adjustment. If I can be okay with him seeking out other connections as long as I know he’s not looking to replace me. And that could allow me to seek affection on the days he’s not able. Not necessarily sex, but emotional connections and maybe some cuddling...?

I love him so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I want to travel to other states and countries together and I want to get a nice apartment with our gaming computers set up side by side. He makes me the best version of myself and every time I make him laugh or smile I feel like the luckiest person in the world.

If he feels the same way about me but needs to seek out other people who also make him feel that way, I want to be okay with it and I want to learn to be the same way.

Why did he get banned? He didn't know so I looked in my history. He didn't even bother to delete any of it, I never look at my history but still! 

I followed some of the links to find his accounts. Many of his comments had been deleted but in places where people had quoted him, I saw he'd been saying absolutely nasty things. All manner of cyberbullying from insults to posting shock images to long-term trolling efforts. He also threatened to dox people and did dox a couple, posting details about their real lives to places such as kiwifarms and certain imageboards. I saw one fight where someone was attempting to dox HIM, putting our personal information at risk. There were conversations among him and other people making reference to a discord chat where they apparently coordinate this shit.

Reading his Reddit comments you'd think he was an explosively angry, sarcastic, unpleasant and vindictive person. Who starts drama over nothing but seeing a place where he could tear someone down for liking a TV show he doesn't, or something similar. And that's not even touching on the political arguments. Now IRL he is not like this at all but where is that coming from? It was disturbing.

I'm also mad he used MY laptop to act like this. We already had a problem while I was pregnant of catching him having webcam cyber sex with another man. He showed a lot of regret, gave me full access to his devices after that to regain my trust. I wanted to give him a chance to prove himself, I didn't think it would be fair to not give him a chance with the baby coming, well after a few months of never seeing anything suspicious (including none of this drama) I felt no reason to keep checking. So now he betrayed my trust again, and again related to his online behavior. After the cybersex thing I told myself if I ever caught him messing around with someone else again it would be over. Now, I have no proof he's done anything like that this time, but I found he's this shitty person on the internet and had no problem using my computer to facilitate it.

I've been doing a full check of everything tonight, the whole history and downloads and all, I did not find anything sexual. I did find a bunch of what looks like software for making yourself anonymous, I guess he was trying to get around these bans. So I'm running a virus scan incase he infected it with malware.

He does not seem to get why I'm upset. He's saying he hasn't done anything sexual and I saw that for myself. Okay. That doesn't change the fact he didn't ask for permission to use my personal computer, I don't know that he didn't snoop through all my stuff, I don't know he didn't do sexual things that he specifically deleted from the history, I don't know and I *can't* know because he's broken my trust again. Then he just says ""But why does it break your trust, I didn't cheat!"" Then when I say I'm disgusted at the things he posted he says everyone does it and it doesn't mean anything. He wasn't ""actually"" angry he just thought it was funny entertainment. He did it because he was bored while our daughter was napping. So he trolls his way across a dozen sites at age 31 getting hit with bans left and right chuckling over being an asshole to strangers? The whole thing seems so immature to me that I've sort of lost some respect for him. Like he could read a book, play games, learn something new, text a friend. Hell I wouldn't care if he just binged netflix whole time she's napping. Instead he does this?

I don't know how to get through to him... help?? Bottom line I just don't feel like I can trust him on the internet. If it's not one thing it's another. He's been banned from the Steam gaming community too before. At the same time it seems wrong to break up over how he uses the internet, when he's been a great boyfriend otherwise and a great father.

What would you do here?

TL;DR: While being a stay at home dad and working on his degree my boyfriend has also been using my computer to cyberbully people on sites he was banned from on his own. Says he did it out of boredom. The sort of person he acted like in those posts isn't someone I like at all. Using my computer also feels like he violated my privacy.",relationship_advice

An example would be when we play a game and he lets me win. For a while I just went along with it because I assumed he liked it. Eventually I told him he could stop letting me win and he admitted that he was. Next time we play he lets me win and I tell him to stop, he doubles down insisting that he never let me win, and now I dislike sharing a mutual hobby we have. Another time we were having sex and he asked me to make whatever that hentai face is called, I say no and he lies saying he was just kidding. I knew he was lying but I got over it. A few nights ago I found his huge hentai folder and he insisted that he doesn’t enjoy hentai as if I’m stupid and don’t understand anything that’s going on. Now I feel insecure and belittled because if he insists on hiding it, it must be something negative. No matter how many times I have told him his lying is obvious, he continues to do it like I don’t know what the fuck is going on.

And by expensive, I mean items that are $500-$1500. The past 5 months alone she's spent probably $3000 on me, and she's not making that much money herself, she works part time and probably makes less than $30k/year and has her own bills/loans to deal with.

880,e6ap4e,TigerAndDeer,1575514235.0,1,I moved away and didn't tell her.,"Long story short: my family moved me to a new town. I met my best friend (we'll call her Anne) there at church and we became extremely close.

Fast forward. I graduate from college and everything's fine. As soon as she graduated from college a semester later, she cut me off with no explanation. Whenever I'd ask to hang with her she'd give me weird (read:lame) excuses and after a while it just seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me.

And no, it wasn't because we became career women with separate paths after graduating. I worked 2 jobs after I graduated, and Anne didn't have to work after graduating because she has rich parents.

I finally got a really good job this year, finally giving me enough income to only have to work 1 job AND  leave my toxic home so I moved out and I no longer live in that city I met Anne.

A really close friend of mine still lives in that city (we'll call her Rose). I still hang out with Rose and we'll still meet up with each other despite living in different areas now. 

According to the story Rose told me, Anne had asked  where I'd been (Rose is aware of what happened with me and Anne). Rose said ""she moved away months ago? Are you just now noticing that she hasn't been coming to our church anymore?""

So I got a text from Anne after that asking why I didn't tell her I left. I haven't replied yet. I have no idea if I should tell her the truth or not. What should i say? She cut me off without explanation and now she's demanding one. Part of me wants to be petty and do the same to her, but the other part of me does remember that she was my best friend and I want to get that load off my chest",relationship_advice
881,e6ao00,throwRA00112299,1575514092.0,1,My (22F) husband (28M) either yells at or stonewalls me,"My husband and I are both from the U.S. and we have been together for about 3 years. 

I've been having this problem with him where he only ever yells at me or stonewalls me; there is rarely ever an in-between. We can't have an argument without him escalating to yelling at me, for which I am always blamed. He always tells me that he didn't want to have the conversation in the first place, but since I pushed him I can't be upset with him for yelling at me (or, as he says, being angry). For the record, I don't mind him being angry. I know he's entitled to his feelings, but I do mind that he yells at me so much. He does this whenever I want to talk about anything. Any problem, any conversation that could possibly turn into a fight, he almost always either won't talk with me or will grudgingly accept having a conversation, start yelling at me when he's decided he's all done, and then tell me it's my fault because I pushed him to have a conversation when he didn't want to. He NEVER wants to. I can't stress that enough. He'll shut down the conversation midway when he's decided it won't go anywhere and he doesn't want to deal with trying anymore, and if I don't immediately accept that, he'll just yell at me for the whole rest of the conversation. Usually he'll actually start yelling before that and when I try to ask him to stop he'll yell at me to stop talking to him then because he's angry and I can't expect him to ""not yell when he needs to."" I can't have a conversation with him that doesn't go one of those couple of ways, so nothing ever gets resolved or even discussed productively. 

I'm really sad, and I don't know what to do. I guess I should probably just not talk to him when he says no, but that's seriously all the time and we would literally never talk about anything otherwise. When I tried to talk to him about it tonight after it happened again, he did say that he knows the yelling is a problem and he shouldn't but that it's still my fault for trying to talk to him when he doesn't want to. Again, he never wants to. I tried to bring up that he stonewalls me and that makes it very hard to just always accept that he doesn't want to talk, and he vehemently denied it, yelling at me that he has no idea what I'm talking about. He also yelled, in response to me saying that it's hard to just not talk to him whenever he says he doesn't want to get into something because he stonewalls me, ""fine! Just keep fucking doing what you're doing then! Don't fucking change anything!"" 

What should I do? I'm not unwilling to not talk all the time, I'm just unwilling to never resolve anything. Right now, with his responses, that's always what happens. I don't want to make him so miserable, and I need help. I'm pretty miserable myself. I'm tired of being yelled at, misunderstood, not communicated with, blamed for everything, and told to ""just change if I want to make him not so miserable.""

He broke up with me, I was completely shocked. He has his own business and it wasn't doing well and he said he needed to focus on work.  In April he said we could be in an open relationship and he didn't want to commit to a full relationship because he didn't think he feels emotionally lost. We act like a couple, say I love you, FaceTime, and spend weekends together but I'm getting really frustrated because I want a real relationship. We were together for four years before we broke up. I'm not sure how to get him to commit, I've come close to giving him ultimatums before but I   change my mind at the last second because I don't think ultimatums are fair. 

He says he doesn't want to commit because if he commits then he'll feel pressured about the next steps that logically come in a relationship (like moving in together (we lived together before), going on trips, getting married). I'm really not sure what to do. Everyone says I should leave him, but I really, really want to be with him. Any thoughts on how I could get him to commit? I'm really frustrated and confused. He's supposed to come stay with me this Sunday to Wednesday and then we're going on a trip together before Christmas, I just don't know what to do and I feel really sad and hopeless. I expressed all of these feelings to him last night over FaceTime and he said that he couldn't be a good boyfriend right now. I do see our relationship progressing where we're starting to do more things together (like to on trips, say I love you again) but it's just not enough. He also won't tell his family about me.

Also, he's involved in some weird things online where he's friends with a bunch of famous IG models and he has them all comment on his pictures. He tells me that it's just business and he's using them to expand his business but I'm insanely jealous... What do you guys think?

885,e6akob,yourmomsasnowblower,1575513674.0,0,I (28m) have strong feelings for my engaged friend (25f). She reciprocates the feelings.,"Tldr: my ""ex"" from high school is engaged. We haven't talked in 8 years up until last week. Now we both have serious feelings for each other and I have no clue how to handle this. 

Oh lord. I don't even know where to begin with this. I guess we need a little information about myself and our history. I'm doing this on mobile bc reddit refuses to work in landscape mode on my tablet. So no key board. 

   So about me. I am single. I've been single for going on 3 years now. It's more or less by choice. I work a lot. I have 2 boys (8 and 4). I got hurt to many times and just kind of pushed women away and started living my life. I've talked to women here and there but I never really let any get close. I just enjoy hiding behind my walls. The other thing that comes into play later (and as anyone reading this may bring up) but I have a really strong moral compass. I always try to do what's right, in every aspect of my life. I'm not perfect by any means. But this is way out of my scope of anything I'd ever fuck up.

   So let's call her Lyn. We actually met the first time when I was a sophomore in high school 2007 ish. She was in 8th or 9th grade (we were in different school districts anyway.) We met thru my sister. So whatever. We hung out and eventually ""dated"" as much as two teens could at the time. I honestly can't even remember why we broke up. Looking back I think we just went our separate ways. Whatever. We were young kids.

   Its 2011 now. Lyn and I have not talked once since or even seen each other. Matter of fact, I graduated (2010) and literally left the state and moved 1100 miles away to live with my father. Somehow, we end up talking again. Now I don't remember the specifics. We talked for at least 6 months. We're a little older now. So we talk and play video games together. Text and call and Skype etc. Standard 2011 long distance shit. Now this is where the fuck up starts. I actually decided to drive to see my mom for Christmas that year. So logically I surprised Lyn too and saw her. We hung out all week. Had a blast. Towards the end of the week tho, an ex from HS shows up on my doorstep with a 10 month old saying its mine (he is). Now this is legitimately the first I've ever heard of this kid. So 19 yo me having no clue what to do, shut down totally. For a week or two I didn't talk to anyone. I honestly tried to hide from the world. From my mom. Lyn. The kid and ex. Etc etc. I don't remember much from that time period but this is the result. I literally walked out of Lyns life. It was the shittiest thing I've ever done to anyone and I thought about it over the years. 

   So fast forward to last week. Its 2019. Tuesday or wednesday before Turkey Day. I get a friend request on FB from Lyn and a message that just says ""hey."" Now I'm really torn. I've thought about her over the years (not crazy mind you). I just felt bad about how I handled her. I was really having a moral dilemma about answering this message. I was really confident she just wanted to ream me a new asshole for what I did. After a bunch of internal debating. I responded saying hi. I couldn't fix what I did but at the very least. If she was still mad at me, I'd let her get it off her chest to me directly. I really wish she had yelled at me at this point. She says hi, ask how I am etc. After a day or so of chatting and catching up we discuss what happened. She's understanding. Obviously she's moved on. The one thing I mentioned early on was to just make sure her fiance knew about me. If it was an issue. I'd leave. She tells her fiance (let's call him Bob). Bob seems ok with it. She told him our whole history etc. 

   This is where it starts to go down hill. Lyn and I are texting every day now all day. Both our jobs allow us to play on our phones. It's honestly totally innocent. It's just jokes. How our day is going. Memes. Etc. Also 8 years of catching up. Fast forward a few days. And here's where it goes really down hill. She sent me a message on s snapchat asking me something. I forget to be honest but the end result is this. She hints at having feelings for me. She knows she shouldn't but does. Even admits to over the years having thought about me and trying to reach out. We discuss it and don't really come to a huge conclusion. I just told her that I don't want to be the reason her and Bob split. If she wants me to leave, I will. It was never my goal to end up here. I was just happy to have a friend back. Fast forward couple more days. It's like  6PM. She disappeared bit that's no big deal. We don't really say good night or anything. Figured she settled down and went to bed. 2 hours later I recieved a message saying ""Anand there it is."" Now I knew instantly what it was but we discuss it. Bob doesn't like nor want her talking to me anymore. Now i should've walked out by now. But nope. I fucking can't. We continue talking but only in private. 85% of what were discussing is totally harmless and memes still. The remaining 15% is her and I talking about this shit ass situation we've created. Lyn has been with Bob for 6 years. They're engaged. Shes never cheated on him. Never considered another man. They had an amazing relationship until I walked into her life. She shouldn't be talking to me and I shouldn't be responding. But we are. She admits that she does have feelings for me but this is wrong. She's engaged and loves this man but we've also discussed a lot of specifics. Her wishing we had gotten a real chance. Down to the logistics of her potentially moving. I've mentioned a few points. Mainly being. If she was totally committed to Bob, this never wouldve happened. Also Bob is in the right for his gut instinct, but telling your fiance who she can and can't talk to is a red flag in my opinion. Obviously someone is walking away hurt from this situation. Her response always comes back to this tho. She loves Bob and doesnt want to hurt him. She's trying to put a pin in it. Recall tho. I don't want to split them. Yeah, it would be nice to try but I'm not pretty enough to purposely split them and try to steal her. 

   So here we are. We're still talking. A couple inappropriate sexual things were said today. I'm very well aware shes emotionally cheating on him and I'm helping that. No pics or anything like that has been exchanged. The only note worthy thing I have to add really is that there is something about Lyn. It's not a physical attraction or sexual or anything. But I am unbelievably just drawn to her. We have similar interest and very similar sense of humor. It's hard to explain. We just click really well. Flawlessly almost. I don't believe in god or fate and we may not even be meant for each other but I cant shake her coming in and out of my life 3x now as some kind of sign. I woke up this morning and had a huge mental breakdown because I know what Im doing is morally wrong. I'm slowly ruining this relationship but I just can't stop talking to her. And that's even worse because I have been in this mans shoes before. I broke up with my ex bc she just talked to everyone. Behind my back and then eventually openly. The interesting part, she feels the same way about the attraction thing. There's probably more I'm missing and bits I left out on accident. Lyn has waltzed into my life and wrecked thru every wall I've put up over the years. I cannot get her out of my mind and I've never felt this way about a woman. I'm probably ruining their relationship because sooner or later he's going to find out and it's going to be a huge issue. So either I take a walk. Or he does. In which case, I'm not sure I'd swoop in to begin with bc what kind of foundation would that even be or if she would even want me. I honestly just want my friend but the attraction we have is making this difficult. I don't expect any magical answers. Or even good advice. I really needed to tell someone. And have no one. So everyone will do.",relationship_advice
886,e6ak27,hauehje,1575513594.0,1,Boyfriend gave me STD,"My boyfriend and have been on and off for almost a year now. We had one breakup which lasted for 2 months. During this past year with him, I only slept with him, even during our breakup I did not sleep with anyone new. He, however, handled the breakup differently. He downloaded tinder and ended up having sex with 5-7 girls in that time. We were in a long distance relationship but when we got back together the most previous time (after the 2 month breakup where he went wild) I had asked him to get tested before I came to see him. He said he did and that it was clean. A week or two after that weekend, we were great but my body was not. I was having trouble going to the bathroom and felt sick at least 4/7 days a week with my tonsils swelling up and a fever. The whole time I figured it was the cold or flu and that it was pass. After 4 weeks of being sick, and spending those 4 weeks with him and making great memories as it felt like our relationship was getting better, this past weekend was unbearable. I was with him for thanksgiving break and on my death bed the whole time. Really bad fever, my tonsils were so inflamed I couldn’t eat, drink, sleep, barely breathe, and it was painful swallowing my own saliva. By this time, I figured the problem was my tonsils and just wanted to get them removed. I talked to a teledoc who told me I had strep and prescribed me antibiotics; he was wrong. This past Sunday I couldn’t function and we went to the Emergency Room together. They ran tests for mono, strep, chlamydia, gonorrhea, etc. They kept me overnight at the hospital due to my pain conditions. They let me go the next day and I flew home later that night. The next day I got a call from the hospital telling me about my test results and that I had gonorrhea in my throat. I couldn’t fathom this news because the reason why I don’t sleep with a lot of people is because I don’t want to catch an STD; I’ve slept with only 5 people in my life. And now I have to clean up someone else’s mistake. I immediately called him and said, “ I thought you used condoms?? They told me I have gonorrhea.” He of course turned it around on me and said it was probably from my ex boyfriend that I hadn’t slept with in over a YEAR, asking me when the last time I got tested (which was this past summer before going back to school), and saying that if I have it he has it now too, completely blaming me for what I have to go through because of HIS actions. He then called me and said he can’t deal with being with me after knowing that this pain was all because of him, doing the whole you’re fried I quit bullshit. I hung up on him and we haven’t talked since, he hasn’t tried to reach out either. So not only do I have to deal with this painful disease that I have gotten treated for but will take 10 days until the pain goes away (according to the doctors), but I also have to deal with this breakup. And after the last 4 weeks of being with him I feel more in love and attached than ever.

Ok, maybe this will be a slightly longer post, I'm thankful for everybody reading this and leaving a comment. As the title suggests, it's about my relationship with my father and how things aren't quite right between us. Maybe typing this out will already help me figure things out, so I'll just start at the **very** beginning of the whole thing.

I've always lived in a very small town somewhere in the middle of nowhere and were raised completely by my mother. I've  always lived just with her and don't remember living together with my dad. I think he moved out when I was like 2yo and my parents got divorced when I was 4 (which I weirdly do recall, say the actual day they did it). So my mom was a single mother with no job in the beginning and had to handle everything on her own, since my dad also didn't pay any child support (he officially didn't have the money but he was always working on the side without paying taxes). My mom raised me, went to school on her own, worked, did the household and literally everything else all by herself without any help. During that time, my father visited me about once a week and for me this was the absolute highlight. Because I didn't know how ""family life is supposed to be"", this was self-explanatory to me. My mom does everything and is always there and my dad is the absolute hero who comes once a week with a cool car (my mom didn't have a car, he came also to help my mom with groceries shopping) and with whom I'm always on adventures, because he was the only way, we could get out of the village. The thing is, he was and still is incredibly unreliable and quick with words. He would constantly give me awesome promises like buying motorbikes and shit. Ofc he never held any of them and he also very often just didn't come when my mom and me were waiting for him without sending a sign of life for the whole day. So child-me was all pumped-up for daddy to come, prepared paintings I could give him and shit, and daddy didn't come so I cried my soul out and mommy again had to put up with everything. Sad life.

Later in my early teens I developed a somewhat bad relationship to my mom because I made her responsible for me being ""the poor kid"" in class, the one without a car or a house. Sucks to admit that, but my 12yo me was an absolute ungrateful ass to my mom. My dad was still the hero for me in some sense, because he was the kind of ""outlaw"" I wanted to be, as edgy as I was. He kinda helped me with my mom for some time, but it was still more the image I had of him than what he really did. 

Even later, say 15/16 I developed anger issues out of anxieties and after breaking down multiple times, breaking things and cutting myself, I decided to see a doc. I did this first step alone and got into therapy really quickly. I told my mom, went to therapy and this is were things get really interesting. Because therapy basically showed me, that my problems are actually deeply rooted in the disappointments that were my father when I was a child. After this, I rationalized my image of my father, started to really appreciate my mother, fell into a short hole of guilt for being an ass for so long to her, but recovered and ever since my mom and me are an absolute dream team. The relationship I have with my mom is perfect, she always supports me, she did everything to make me as happy as she could and hold my hand during therapy always showing me that if I fall, it's only into her arms. 

With my dad it's a different story. During therapy he always was like ""why are you doing that, you're a happy child aren't you? Me and your mom did everything for you!"". It's important to note here, that he came to this country from half way across the globe when he was like 18 and that he's a somewhat religious muslim. After therapy and in the last couple of years, I realized what a hypocrite he actually is, I started to remember all the disappointments (him missing my 18 birthday was the worst) and I developed a lot of anger towards him. Anger about how he left me, about how he didn't help my mom, how he couldn't keep a single promise, but most of all, anger about how he always brags about being the best father he could possibly be. E.g. I'm succeeding in life with uni and scholarship going strong and I'm \*very\* thankful for that. This is, because I gave my best, because my mom did everything she could and because of luck. But my dad always talks about how I'm doing good because he raised me so well, everywhere and to everybody. I honestly believe, he really thinks, that he was a great father and how he made me what I am today and that pisses me off in some many ways and in such intensity that I can't even put it in words.

But in another way I also get him, and this is where the tone of this text switches. See, my dad's life has been an absolute mess. He came here with 18, no idea where to go or what to do. The bit of family he had here treated him like trash so he ran away. Didn't speak the language, didn't know a single soul. He kinda managed to pull through and eventually met my mom, got married and had a child. Business was also going great, life's won right? Then he lost his business, lost my mom, lost me, got another woman and another business, lost all that again, lost his mom without seeing her for 20 years, lost his dad without seeing him for 4 years. He has no family left in this country, no money, no friends, lives on his own and his 10ish pets he keeps to cope with the loneliness are also dying off one by one. I'm literally the only thing in his life, that worked out, maybe not so much because of him, but I see why he keeps telling himself that. His life's an absolute train wreck and I feel super bad for him. It's also important to note, that he does love me more than anything and that he does care for me and that he also just wants the very best for me, his only child. I'm very sure about that.

And that brings me to the current state and the actual dilemma I'm in. I live alone, I'm in my 20s and doing just fine. But lately he started to really care and worry for me. He checks on me by phone almost daily and everytime I leave the house or go on a trip, he demands me to tell him, where I am and how I'm doing frequently. Suddenly it's him asking me, if he can come and visit me. Suddenly he's the one missing someone and I'm the one who's missing. He also frequently tries to guilt-trip me into spending more time with him, seeing hime once every week which I simply cannot do. And since he found his way back to islam lately, and I'm living the complete opposite live of a muslim, he tries to persuade me into becoming a believer. While doing all that, he continuously places himself above me, suggesting he's the father so the child should obey. I can't really talk to him, because of that. He immediately dismisses everything I say and refuses to talk about or acknowledge his own feelings.

That's it with the write-up, thank you so much if you read all of this I'm so sorry for this barrage of text.

I think, my actual problem now is, that I'm not sure how to establish a healthy relationship with him. I'm, on my hand, constantly swinging back and forth between anger towards and pity for him and everytime I try to work on myself, he's completely blocking off any suggestion or talk. Every time I tell him to stop doing something like trying to surveillance me or convincing me of religion, he either ignores it or says ""sure honey, no problem"" just to start doing it again a couple of minutes later. He basically doesn't respect my boundaries and I don't know how to establish a relationship in which he does. Also I want to become more at ease with him, I want to stop holding him responsible for things that are fare gone by. Maybe I just want to know, how to forgive him. But how?",relationship_advice
890,e6ag8t,DippedIceCream,1575513055.0,1,How do I (F21) express my insecurities to my boyfriend (M25),"We have been together for about 4.5 months and have been in long distance relationship for 1.5 months now. I am currently finishing a job in Canada  before going back to France (where he is). In France we would be 3 hours train away.

We met on tinder, I met a few of his friends but not that much and those I met, only one became a good acquaintance/friend. He always had great relationship with his friends and some of his best friends are girls. I am good with that, I think it's a good sign he gets along well with females. One of his best (girl) friend came to see him for an entire month and another one he his very close too (marathon running together, trips etc). For context, that was before we met.

Last week-end he drove 2 hours with another (girl) friend to see his friend who came 1 month in Canada to see him.

Today we were supposed to call each other but he was too tired to wait after I finished work. I was tired and sick and with the insecurities I started to think something was wrong. 

I trust him, I don't think he would do something to hurt me, but seeing that he goes to this extent to see girls (friends first I know but girls still) makes me a bit insecure (even more so with the fact I haven't seen him for so long) 

I am trying to get better at expressing my feelings, it's difficult for me communicating clearly.

How do I make him understand that I need some reassurance coming from him about spending a lot of time with girls without making it sounds like I am jealous or don't want him to see them (which is not the case, I would love to meet them one day) ?",relationship_advice

Over the last 12-18 months have been feeling more and more alone and isolated in our marriage. When i was asked if things were ok i would say sure. i thought it was just a feeling that would pass with time etc.

four months ago i started chatting to a fellow teammate that i played indoor with. one day she saw how depressed i seemed and simply asked if i was ok. the damn wall broke and i talked about everything. she helped me with advice and just suggested if i wasn't happy i should leave. Feelings started to develop for this woman, so much so that they were reciprocated. nothing physically happened just feelings. feelings that i have never really had for anyone else before. 

my wife found out about this and told me to stop talking to her and she was manipulating me etc etc. i shut down the conversations, stopped playing indoor. This did not help, if anything the feelings started getting worse. i lasted two weeks without talking to her before i started again. my wife found out a week later and lost her shit because i had broken a promise.

I started the process again of not talking to her. this only a week went by. 

I have such strong feelings towards her, she is always on my mind. I've stopped talking to her for now and after two days she called to see if i was ok because i had retreated without saying anything to her and she was concerned. I've never been this way in my entire life. i have never had such feelings for someone, not even my own wife.

My relationship with my father has become increasingly strained due to how he chooses to interact with others and myself.  He is single, has had girlfriends since divorcing my mother.  He was already dating the first woman since my parents divorced, they are still friends but he doesn't have ""warm and fuzzy feelings"" he also had a different girlfriend who was the ""love of his life"" and he started dating other people while she was in hospice because it ""wasn't that of companionship anymore"".  He has always been quick to give unwanted advice and has not been good at receiving any in return.  Due to his continued pressure and the pressure of my family I have tried to maintain a relationship with him and I do love him but the relationship grows increasingly strained.  He came to Thanksgiving this year and told some other family members that he was going to be meeting up with a 30 year old he met online who is also as interested in photography as he is and is was raising money to go on a trip to Barcelona.

We wouldn't have found out about this Barcelona Photographer had it not been for my younger cousin who he told.  When we were commenting on how weird it was that he was talking to someone that young and likely offering them money she told us all that he had also sent her some questionable messages.  The messages he sent her continue to display his poor understanding of what is socially acceptable.  He thinks that it is a compliment and doesn't see anything wrong with it when questioned.

I've been talking to this girl for about a year. She's very smart and very close with her parents (her dad's really nice). We've gotten to be really close friends and when we hand out it's really fun. About half a year ago though, I admitted  that I had feelings for her. She basically said that she wasn't interested in dating anybody, but that she didn't have any problem with me specifically. This hurt a lot and it continued to hurt over the next 6 months after we continued to become better friends and had more talks about this subject of dating. Then a while ago she told me she had started to like me, but the next day said she wasn't sure about it and goes back and forth on the idea of dating. We went to homecoming together and it still feels like she likes me. I don't know what to do because I don't want to keep being just friends, but since she still doesn't want to date, I just either have to suffer through the pain or stop hanging out with her. This feels selfish though because that would ruin the friendship, it wouldn't be fair to her and It would also hurt a lot because she's one of my best friends.

898,e6aa1n,ThrowRa-11111,1575512205.0,0,I think I(18F) wrongly accused my now ex boyfriend(18M) of assaulting me and he now thinks he’s abusive,"I think it’s only fair to give some background first and what lead up to the altercation. 

Me and my boyfriend (now ex) are each other’s first relationship. We have been together since we were both 16, and now we both go to the same university. I have to be honest, he’s never ever treated me badly. We loved each other a lot, he would always do cute little things for me, never once hurt me. Always me made me feel safe and cozy. 

The problem started a week ago. Looking back at it, I started it. It’s exam season and we’ve both been studying. He decided to ask me if I wanted to go out to eat and I said sure. I told him I wanted to get back early to study and he promised me we would. We ate and I told him to hurry up and finish, he said sure. Everything was fine. On the way back there was construction, but I’m pretty certain there was an easier way back to avoid construction. I told him about it, but he said it was too late and the traffic would start moving eventually. However we could have still switched lanes, traffic was at a standstill and somebody would give room. He told me it won’t be long. 

So I did something really stupid here. He left the car in Park because the traffic wasn’t moving, I told him to please switch lanes. I thought he knew what I was doing so I tried to switch gears into Drive, but I accidentally shifted into neutral. The car started rolling back and he slammed the breaks really hard. The car behind just kept honking. 

He was a little mad but he told me to not do that again. We got home later than expected and I told him that’s great sarcastically. He told me he was sorry, but I guess I got annoying and he told me to please stop talking about it. I told him there was a bunch of space between the car behind us and if he listened to me to switch lanes, we could have been home earlier. So he just walked out of the room towards the kitchen to get something to drink. I followed him and just kept repeating myself. 

I know I’m in the wrong, but what he did next hurt me. I was just trying to grab his arm to get his attention. He grabbed my chin and mimicked making my mouth close. He didn’t squeeze or anything. I think he realized I was about to start crying so he loosened up a lot more. I just started crying and ran to the bed to start crying (this is in his dorm room). He quickly came over and said he was sorry. 

I then gave him a huge lecture on what women go through and how he’s abusive. That this sort of stuff leaves women with permanent memories and trauma. He then started  tearing up and started crying. This was the first time I’ve seen him cry. He kept saying sorry and said he will seek help. And he started crying and just cried. 

I had told him I was leaving and started gathering my backpack. He just laid in bed and cried. It did break my heart seeing him cry and be so vulnerable. When I cry he always hugs me and cuddles me but obviously I couldn’t do that as I just broke up with him. Regardless, I still felt slightly bad and went over and started rubbing his shoulder and gave him a little peck on the cheeks. I told him I was leaving. He said he was sorry and that was about it. 

I still love him and really miss him, but I’ve read one too many things online about how men can’t get away with these sort of things. I talked to my friends and they said they have had exes who have done worse, like slapped them. But if I felt threatened it’s valid. 

My friend say they saw him at our university counsellors and he is signing up for some rehab/recover group for domestic abusers. 

The thing is he’s so bright and wonderful, I don’t want him to go to those rehab groups. Because I know it can be bad as others are actual absuers go there and they will hurt him. He’s still my baby and even if we are broken up, I’ll still love him for everything he did for me. He never previously hurt me. We are only 18, he’s so smart and bright. I don’t want him thinking he’s so guilty, and I don’t want him being around other abusers. He didn’t even know abuse me to be honest. He’s my baby, I really don’t want him going there, he has a bright future ahead of him. 
I’ve just been crying all day since I found out. He’s my baby. 


Should I contact him to tell him not to go. I felt like I accused him of something he really didn’t do. The stuff I said was extreme. I want to see him succeed, others at the group will just make him feel worse.

I accused my boyfriend of abusing me, but I’m not sure if he really did or not. He’s seeking help, but I know he doesn’t require it. I don’t want him to blow his future away.",relationship_advice

Would like to preface this with, I am fully aware of how insecure/jealous this whole issue makes me sound (and feel). (My relationship has been 2 years and we’ve never had problems but this situation genuinely make me question his maturity and if I want to be with him). My(21) boyfriend(20) is a good boyfriend to me and treats me well. I’ve never been given any real suspicion as to him having ever been unfaithful to me, but as stated in the title, it is my biggest fear and I am unbelievably paranoid about it constantly. I used to frequent the Instagram activity page (before it got removed) and about a year ago I had to mention “hey, do you not think it’s weird that you like 800+ girls half naked thirst-trap pictures(of girls from our town, not random models/people) when you have a girlfriend... and you are fully representative of me(by having pictures of me on his page)????(That was a really calm run down, I was actually bright red with anger and shame and cried a bit). He told me he didn’t see it like that, he only did it because he wanted to get people to like his pictures back. He apologized and told me that was never his intention but wouldn’t let it happen again. from what I could tell he still follows unbelievable amounts of girls but wasn’t liking all of their pics. Since then, Instagram has been a touchy subject for us. I’ll walk in the room & ill see him close that app so fast. If he’s on his phone in front of me he will NeVeR open Instagram or Snapchat (I’ll get into that in a second). If I would be on Instagram and notice he was active on Instagram I would try to look over at him (honestly just to get a reaction at this point) and he will always close out of it. His Instagram is always active at like 3am (when I’m asleep) or in the morning when I’m at work. I talked to a male friend and he told me he could be doing it out of respect for me, knowing that I don’t want to see that shit on his phone. But if he wants to respect me why does he literally only follow 800+ girls who are basically hotter versions of me (I know his type). Also, Snapchat. He has streaks with like 20+ random girls I’ve never even heard of. He has female friends and I know them and have 0 problems with it, it’s the names that pop up on his phone that I’ve never heard of that really bother me. I mentioned it one time and he said “I just like having streaks, I only message them once day to keep the streak. Most of his streaks are slightly longer than him and i’s (which was during the 2 months he was single)(I’ve also heard he had a hoe phase so that doesn’t make me feel better). I don’t understand streaks, why you would message someone everyday who you have no interest in talking to is beyond me. But basically, I know he snaps a bunch of girls that he was (likely) interested in before we started dating. I don’t necessarily think he has bad intentions or is being shady but I literally think about it constantly (which i know is ridiculous) and because of that I feel like I should mention it so he knows it bothers me but it’s just such a stupid thing to have to talk about. 
What really sparked the anger in me enough to post this was I noticed he was active on Instagram the other night(1am ish) (when I was home for thanksgiving) but wasn’t responding to my messages for 30+ min. So I casually slipped in that “men are hoes on Instagram” in conversation and after that he changed his settings so I can’t see when he’s active anymore, so he knows I’m aware and annoyed by it...
I don’t know what to even say to him about it that doesn’t just fully make me sound like an insecure bitch. I want him to know if he feels like he has to hide his Instagram from me, he shouldn’t be following who he follows. 
(Side note #1, also in public I have to deal with him staring at other women constantly (which makes me feel like shit) (also I’m bi, so I understand women are nice to look at but could you be less gross about it constantly))
(Side note #2, he’s not necessarily guarded over his phone but he’s not as loose as I am with it. I can hand him my phone and let him do whatever with no worries, but I don’t feel the same about his. He’ll leave it sitting on the couch if he’s in the other room or something but normally holds onto it)
(Side note #3, I know if I straight up told him “if you don’t quit using those apps I’m going to break up with you” that he would(he’s very clear to me that he’s serious about us and that he wants to marry me..etc). I obviously don’t want to do that though, I want him to understand how he is coming across to me and make a conscious decision to not do something that he knows bothers me)",relationship_advice

903,e6a3xk,TheMegaMeme,1575511452.0,2,I asked this girl out a couple weeks ago and now I don’t know what to expect or what to do,"[19m]

Long story short, I saw this cute girl and started taking to her after class. After having a conversation for about an hour I decided to ask her to go get smoothies after class. She said she would go but she said would it change your mind if I had a boyfriend? I told her my intentions were as a date and she told me she was sorry but she really liked me. Her boyfriend doesn’t go to our school. I’ve never seen him and she doesn’t talk about him.

Ever since then me and this girl talk to each every day or every other and even have a sort of “unofficial meeting spot” and I feel like we are getting closer to each other but I am really confused. The more I talk to her the more I like her and the more we find out how much we have in common. No girl after asking them out has hung out with me afterwards especially like this when it didn’t result on going on a date.

I swear too she talks to me differently than other her other friends as well. When we talk it’s almost always 1 to 1 except sometime one of her or my friends come to join us. When she talks with her friends she’ll often slouch on the couches or lay down. When she talks to me though she always sits up and pays attention and seems more engaged. We talk more about ourselves and our feelings than when we are with a group of people.

I’m just generally confused and I get excited and sad after talking to her. I get excited that maybe she does see me as a potential romantic partner but won’t dump her boyfriend (understandable and a big risk) and I’m also sad because at the end of the day she is not my girlfriend and I have all these pent up emotions inside. I try looking for other girls but I can’t help but compare them to her and I can’t find myself trying to get with another girl unless I like them as much or more than her. 

What is this relationship and where is it going. What should I do and what should I expect?

I asked out a girl who has a boyfriend but she still continues to talk to me a lot now on a regular basis. Her boyfriend doesn’t go to our college and she doesn’t talk about him. We talk a lot and we have definitely gotten closer. We talk about each other and know a lot about each other. I think she likes me but it’s too much of a risk to  break up with her boyfriend who she is already with. I’ve been looking for other girls in the meantime as well but I can’t help but compare them to her and I can’t find myself dating anyone else unless I like them as much or by some miracle more, more than her.",relationship_advice

A little about me;

* I am bi
* I have dated a girl before as well as a boy
* I don't really know if I like Jennie

A little about Jennie

* She has hinted at liking girls before (but Idk if she was making a joke)
* She likes a lot of guys
* she always likes someone. I don't remember a time when she didn't like anyone. She says it makes her happy.
* She jokes around a lot.

So lately Jennie has been doing things like giving me hugs, and saying love you before she leaves school. Now I don't think much of it because she hugs everyone and has a really bubbly personality. She is also very cuddly? I don't know how to say that but she is really comfortable hugging or sitting with people, or laying her head on her friends shoulders. I have also heard her say love you to one over her other really close friends. Jennie also tells me i'm pretty or cute sometimes but I don't know if she's just trying to help get my confidence up. I don't know how to deal with this, as she is a good friend of mine and I don't want to ruin that by confronting her if she doesn't like me. I will post updates if anything else happens.",relationship_advice

I'm not the type of guy to full on cry because I like to stay calm and think of the situation.
Nothing happened before hand and everything was good.
I believe her college work and my parents disapproval have made her depressed to the point where she lost feelings.

But I was still so angry at so many of the comments? Why were you guys coming for me for not bringing my phone? It was broken and I was with people I knew. Was I supposed to know that this guy was going to take advantage of me like that? If I was ""prepared"", wouldn't everybody tell me I'm wrong for assuming this was going to try and assault me? **""Not all men""** and all that? 

Which one is it?

All I know is that I felt really blamed during a time where I blamed myself the most.

To those who told me to drop my friend, she was NOT in on it at all. Her and her bf drove away to makeout and came back, she was caught off guard when she us hooking up. She thought bc we hated each other so much, that hate turned into something more. That we ""hate made-out"" with each other bc of the tension. She explained it so much better than I can. That's why she was cheering us on, because she was shocked and impressed. She feels so bad for leaving me, but it wasn't her fault.

Her boyfriend was in on it and she dropped his ass as soon as he told him what was up. He thought that the second we were alone, we'd get freaky. They've been together for 9 months, but he knew that I never even had my first kiss and had no intention of having it anytime soon. She dropped him in 0.2 seconds. 

As for the guy I was in the car with, I just kept my distance. I blocked him on all social media and I never talked to him again. I didn't even send him an angry message or cuss him out. That would take up so much energy. 

I'm doing so much better. I'm not completely over it, but I feel happy and healthy. Haven't told any loved ones though, my mom has enough to worry about.",relationship_advice

910,e69zxh,zetseth14,1575510954.0,1,Girlfriend is oversensitive to criticism,"We are both 21. We are still at the early stages of our relationship. I admit that I can be light skin at times and I made that clear to her last night. She sensed that there's something wrong, I just felt frustrated because I can't believe some of her views, but that's hers. I never told her that her opininion/beliefs are wrong, instead I said that I have a different one. 

One thing we talked about is the idea of partners. She told me that it's a man's duty to love more than the woman.. I really don't know what the hell she's thinking. It made me think like ""Then you wouldn't try to match that? like I should chase you?"" because my view is different and that when it comes to partners, everyone should do their best, chase each other if they really love each other. 100/100. 

Another one is she believes that in order for a relationship to lasts, there should still be friendship.. I get that it's a good starting point, but in my experience, if I made her feel like I'm a friend then I'll end up in the friendzone. So I'm really not that type of guy to switch it up to that.

And lastly she told me that I wasn't like the other guys whom she had been with. The boys treated her like a princess and shit, take her out on dates and made her feel special. I don't know what the fuck she's thinking, because she made it clear to me that she likes whenever I lead her to do fun stuff and as long as we're together, the place doesn't really matter.

I know I was being a little dramatic last night and I should have known better. I should've restrained myself from saying things that might get misterpreted, but I just let it out because I thought it was safe for me to express myself, but instead she gave me the silent treatement and even dropped the video call immediately.

I don't really know what to do now. We have a date later and we greeted each other this morning, I told her I was okay now and that I'm sorry if I said something she didn't like and that I was just trying to vent and it's nothing against her, I got no intention to hurt her. I told her that it made me feel shit when she dropped the call, but then I still told her that I understand why she did that. She still wasn't okay, I made it clear that we will talk about it later.

Anyway, another issue, but we didn't talk about it is making her feel special all the time and chasing her. I don't think that I failed on giving that, but whenever we fight, like right now, even though I apologized. She still wants me to chase her. Like what the hell is that. I know my worth and I won't do that. I explained myself and she still gives me shit for it. I know my place. I know when I make mistakes and I'll be the first one to admit it, but this time, it's not me. I didn't even hear an apology for what she did last night. This is so frustrating. It's like I got mad then she got mad then I've gotta fix it cause she's mad.

And let me state it clear that I don't tell her to ""Stop being like that"" I always tell her that she has the right to feel what she feels, but why does it turn out that she's the only one who has the right?

Any advice on how I should fix this?

I just think that she's a little bit low self esteem on that part and on some of her views.

I'm open to all criticisms.Thank you very much.",relationship_advice

Now gather around the campfire everyone, it’s time for a story. 

So I met my crush about 3 months ago at school. About 1 1/2 months after I met her, I handed her my phone number. Never talked about it, never called ;(

So then on Halloween, I handed her a card saying “will you be my boo”

Needless to say, she currently isn’t my boo.
Also, during all this she was showing pretty big signs she liked me

So we had a field trip today. I failed to realize she’d be on my bus, so when we were getting on, I timidly asked if I could sit next to her. She said yes, and that felt fucking good. But I soon found out, she liked to talk to the 2 dudes behind us... so on the way to the field trip, I barely participated in the conversation. We arrived at the place, and she instantly found her gal pal, so I was kinda left in the dust ngl.. I walked around the expo hall by myself, feeling like the epic win I had achieved amounted to almost nothing. So skip ahead an 1 1/2 hours, were getting back on the bus. This time I was more involved, but still often ignored.. This time, were headed to a park, where we’d eat lunch, screw around a bunch, then walk back to school. At first I sat down with my crush, one of the dudes that was behind us in the bus. But then she moved to again, her gal pals, but luckily I found my friends this time. So when I was screwing around with my friends, I saw my crush holding hands with another girl. I know some girls do this because they think it’s quirky or something, but I can’t help but think with my luck she’s homosexual...

915,e69ts4,Neverfade1984,1575510190.0,1,My (23F) husband (32M) won’t stop being childish. What do I do?,"I’ve lurked on this subreddit for a long time now and never thought I’d ever have to post anything , unfortunately I have to now. 

I’ve (23F) been with my husband (32M) for 5 years now, married for six months. He’s always been light hearted and funny. He prides himself on being a joker (not like the movie one. He’s sane) and that’s what initially drew me to him. Now it seems like it’s going to far. I thought he’d ease off slightly as he got older, but he hasn’t he still continues his childish ways. 

He continually does stupid things despite me telling him to stop. For instance every single time I bend over or get up he smacks my butt. It’s very annoying. Half the time that he goes in for a kiss he blows into my mouth and completely ruins the mood. He always bursts into hysterical laughter since apparently my face looks funny. A couple years ago we went to a zoo and a bird there made a funny noise. Now he continually makes this noise. Even to this very day. He does it all the time when I’m trying to sleep, when we’re shopping, during sex, all the godamn time. I feel like I’m losing it. 

I love this guy but these antics never stop. He also gets in these moods sometimes where I’m not allowed to talk to him. He just doesn’t feel like talking anymore. Sometimes if I’m childish back especially when he’s in one of these moods he just ignores me and isolates himself. It really hurts my feelings. I’ve asked him to tell me when he’s in one of these moods but he still doesn’t. 

Despite all this we have a lovely relationship. I really see myself being with him forever. How do I get him to stop? It feels never ending. I’m on the last straw and I don’t know how much more I can take",relationship_advice
916,e69trs,presli10,1575510190.0,2,Who is the asshole in this situation?,"To start off, I would like to say that this is a dumb argument that my boyfriend (25M) and I (22F) will have forgotten about this time tomorrow. But because it is still fresh (happened literally 3 minutes ago) I want your all’s opinion to see who is the asshole in this situation. It very well could be the both of us, idk. 

I guess this story really begins at yesterday morning when my bf had his wisdom teeth removed. I sat in the waiting room for 2 hours during the surgery. After his surgery, I picked up his medicine and bought him some soft foods while he slept in my car. Two of the items were individual sized ice cream containers. I ended up eating one of the ice creams myself later that night, which made him furious because apparently I ate the better flavor. If I ate the other ice cream, I’m 100% positive he wouldn’t said that one was the better flavor. I told him I would buy him a new ice cream the following day (which is now today). It should be noted that he felt fine last night and drove to his parents house to pick some stuff up from them. He could’ve easily gotten himself ice cream on the way home, but chose not to. 

So, now let’s talk about today. I worked from 9-3:30 and then immediately went to my mom’s house to type a paper for my organic chemistry course (my laptop is broken so I used her desktop). I worked on that from 4:30-8:00. On my way home, I realized how worn out I was from my day and just wanted to be home. But, I didn’t want to show up without the ice cream I promised. So, instead of stopping at Kroger way down the road, I stopped at Walgreens right across the street from where I live. Walgreens did not have the specific ice cream he wanted but I got a flavor I know he likes. 

As soon as I get home, I notice that my bf is doing homework. He obviously took off work because he didn’t know how he would feel from surgery the day after. As I walked in, he didn’t turn around to say hi to me or acknowledge me at all. He finally turned around after a minute or two to say “I need you to bring me my pain meds” and then went back to his computer. I felt like this was extremely rude. I’ve been gone all day and brought him home ice cream and he can’t even say hi? Fuck that.

So, I decided to sit on the couch (which I had been dying to do all day) and did not fetch his medicine for him. Again, remember I said that he was driving the night before and felt okay overall. Once he realized I sat down he called me a “spiteful bitch” and went to the kitchen himself to get his meds. He looked in the freezer and became even more mad when he realized I didn’t get him the ice cream flavor he wanted. Like how childish can he be? And he’s 25??? I said to him “If you felt like driving to your parents house last night, then you can drive to Kroger and get your specific ice cream. I’ve been gone all day. I just want to chill.” I’m sure he didn’t hear me because he kept repeating “I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care” over my words. He’s back to doing his homework now and I’m sitting on the couch near tears because I don’t see why he is so angry with me. He thinks I’m an asshole for eating one of his ice creams and not replacing it with the exact same flavor, and I think he’s an asshole for the way he acted. 

Again, I know this is a dumb argument. We have been together over 3 years and will definitely get over this, but right now my feelings are hurt and I want to vent.",relationship_advice

He goes out with his friends and I know for sure they try picking up women. I saw him with his friends once when he told me he was going to be working.

919,e69s90,ThrowRA_ThrowRA,1575510001.0,0,I (31F) worry that my fiance (31M) and I are not compatible in some ways and I worry over how significant that is,"My fiance and I have been together for over 4 years now. We love each other and get along really well, but I guess as our wedding approaches, I have doubts. We have some incompatibilities that have been niggling at me more and more lately. 

The first is that he's incredibly specific (sometimes, when it frustrates me, I would more negatively label this as pedantic). So for example, the other day, I was describing something that was bothering me at work, and he gave me a new perspective to look at it with, and I said 'I hadn't thought about that thanks, that's a great point, let's talk about something else now.' This then lead to a twenty minute emotional discussion where he explained to me that I need to phrase things more clearly and say 'ok we can talk about something else now because I feel like this issue is completely resolved and I've moved on.' so that he knows I respect his opinions and I'm happy and not just trying to cut the talk short.

I can certainly see his side of fearing that I'm just trying to shut him up because I am really bad at arguing. My last long term relationship was really abusive, so I have a tendency to just shut down when I think we're going to disagree and try to end it as quickly as possible by just saying ok or nevermind or sorry until it's over. But at the same time, when we do have a disagreement, I feel like after a while, he just repeats the same ideas over and over again with a different phrasing, so then I end up responding to those with the same re-phrased answer and then get bored with the redundacy of it and frustrated that we're still stuck in that cycle. 

The other thing is that our money-management styles are pretty different, or at least, I think that they are. My family grew up on the lower end of the middle class spectrum while his grew up on the higher end. We were usually very comfortable but sometimes we'd go without cable or heat if there was a bad month, while his family was able to pay for his college education in full. So maybe this is why we have different mindsets, because I always want to save as much money as possible and it seems like he wants to spend lots of money. He's always talking about cars (multiple!) that he wants to buy, or watches, or other luxury goods. I feel like a very common topic of conversation for him is the next thing he wants to buy. Part of this incompatibility is that I am terrified of being broke or going into debt, but we have talked a lot about this and we're not actually going to make those other big purchases he just likes to talk about it. But I still worry that there may be some inherent compatibility that he thinks so much about material things that he wants and I don't. I'm not saying he's bad and I'm good, I definitely have a very bad money mind set in the opposite direction of his, I'm just saying that we're different. 

There's some other minor things, of course, but really they're not a big deal. And in every other way, we are pretty good. He's super caring and intelligent and we get on really well and do tons of fun things together. We have disagreements that are bad enough to have a long talk maybe every 3+ weeks and the rest of the time we are just enjoying each other's company. But I worry that maybe there's an inherent incompatibility between us and while it's only ever been a bit frustrating here and there for these past four years, that it could amplify more and more after we get married until we both realize we've made a huge mistake.

I guess this is kinda related to the last post I made [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dz8k6d/am_i_physically_cheating_on_my_girlfriend/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

I'll give u some info before I share my problem.
Me - M19, been in a relationship with my gf for 4 years. Ldr now due to me moving for school. Currently on a Europe trip.
GF - F20, (Prev post mentioned f19, but her bday was a few days ago.) 
S - F19, close friend of mine. We do lots of things together. (See the last post for details if u wanna.)
A - M19 The friend who had a problem with me hanging out with S. (Again, refer to last post.)

After some advice from the last post, I messaged A, and asked him why he was so insistent on getting me to stop hanging out with S. Although at first, he was adamant on the fact that he thought my GF would be uncomfortable with me hanging out with S, after some long talk, he ended up confessing to me that he indeed had a crush on S, and was simply jealous of S, and I's friendship. He told me that S doesn't talk to him as much as me, and when S posted an insta story of a screenshot which was of me video calling S to show her something in Europe, he got really jealous, since he apparently hasn't even had a call with S yet. He has messaged me and asked me to stop hanging out with S, and I'm not sure how to respond to this.

While I understand that somebody could be jealous of S and I's friendship, I don't think it's a big deal since even my gf is okay with it since I have set strict boundaries so that my relationship with S is nothing more than friendship. Also, the fact that he has a crush on S shouldn't mean I should stop hanging out with her, since I've been friends with her longer than I have been friends with A. Furthermore, I am aware of the ""If one of your boys is interested in a girl, you can't make a move on her."" (He keeps bringing this up) however, I dont see my friendship with S as ""making a move on her"" and don't really want to end our long friendship for the sake of A.

**I have talked this through with my husband but he is so easy going and happy in general so it’s a lot of just him agreeing with me to do whatever(cut back, etc) but not seeing any problem. Additional answer for questions I saw about future children, won’t be an issue for us. We are not going to have any children(not a sexed based decision but does benefit sex life obviously). 

For informational purposes I am 28f and Husband is 34m. 

It just recently occurred to me that me and my husband have perhaps more than a healthy amount of sex.  

We went somewhere semi near us (couple hours)for a weekend away. Not a cheap weekend, nice hotel but there was attraction near by we went specifically for. We ended up not really doing anything outside of our hotel room. In the moment I was so happy and enjoying myself to max degree. Afterwards I was disappointed we missed an experience to fuck when we can fuck anytime. (We did not go to attraction, did make it to hotel bar once)

The main categorization of sex addiction I’ve seen is letting it influence your life, take precedent over other obligations, control decision making etc.  this had been suggested to us(by couples therapist years ago) but I never thought it fit the bill for us because we still work and maintain enough of a social circle. 

Lately I have realized we are co-dependent on each other to maybe an unhealthy level but we are happy so I feel conflicted. We have sex minimum one time a day(very rare), on average 3 times a day, and on weekends on average 5 times per day. We’ve been together 5 years, been like this the whole time (save for a few small surgeries/recovery periods) We spend all of our time together, literally like 98/99 percent. We always shower together. Have some form of sexual contact on Breaks/lunch(work from home). Can’t take a long car ride without getting worked up and being incredibly inappropriate or stopping somewhere. We have cancelled plans dozens of times previously and called out of work to just fuck. Never missing unmissable events(weddings,funerals, etc) but optional things for sure. 

My question is has anyone lived like this long term without it escalating, becoming a bigger issue? I worry this isn’t sustainable but since we are so happy I often don’t think it’s that big of an issue. Just looking for some input I guess or reassurance.",relationship_advice
926,e69p6f,anotherchanceneeded,1575509611.0,2,Do I have the right to be P.O.'D at my bf?,"I posted before about holiday plans with my bf and our families. I recently flew to Florida to visit my mom and her new guy for Thanksgiving. I have not seen her in months. We are very close. I asked my bf to come along. He said no for a variety of reasons, too crowded at airports, limited time etc. He tried to get me to stay. His reasoning was I should use my last couple vacation days after Christmas. In my last post I mentioned that it is a very easy work week for me. Mostly a few hours each day for full pay. His mom agreed with me. Actually changed dinner plans to the weekend before Thanksgiving so he could go, eliminating one of his excuses. They ended going to his aunts house for the holiday.

So I go by myself. Had a great time catching up with mom. Her guy is great and treats her like a queen. During the time away bf is calling and texting me constantly. Telling me he missed me etc. Finally I told him to stop. He continued about every hour to text. I am one that feels I should answer as we have dated only about 4 months after being apart for a dozen years, see post history. At one point I turned my phone off, thinking now I could have silenced notifications. He disappointed me by not going but okay it was his decision. On the other hand he could have been part of my weekend. He knows my mom for years. Him interjecting himself into my vacation was a little unnerving.

When I got back he picked me up and took me to my home. I was exhausted. It was a whirlwind few days as mom wanted to show me everything, meeting her friends, a little shopping and the crowded airports. I just wanted to nap and have alone time. He would not give me space as he ""missed me"". He did not give me the chance to miss him. I have not seen him this clingy. It was always me fighting not to be clingy. Finally I told him to go home. 

I don't know if I should be mad at him or think how sweet that he missed me. I wanted him back in my life since we reconnected and I want to stay with him. Is it right to be irritated with him? 

TL:DR My bf had the chance to go awssy with me but chose not to. Then he constrantly called and texted me all weekend interupting family time with my mom.

Edit. We talked a little last night about this. He was mad at himself for not going. He procrastinated so long there were no flights for him to book in the 2 days prior to Thanksgiving. He did apologize for his irritating me with so many texts.",relationship_advice
927,e69onj,LemonSqueezy21619,1575509549.0,2,Fell in love with someone else while in a relationship of 3 years,"Hello everybody. I'm currently in desperate need of impartial advice.

I (22) have been with my current boyfriend (21) for 3 years. A few arguments and disagreements here and there - but nothing too out of the ordinary. I believe we are quite compatible and we have managed to make it work. I really love him and, until recently, I would still get surges of infatuation-like thrill for him - though, of course, diminishing as the years go by.

Then two months ago I met this other person (22). We spent many hours talking to each other and became very close very quickly. Once it became clear that this was not just a very unexpected close friendship and there was more to it, I sounded the alarms and told my boyfriend about it. We set boundaries but ultimately I was still allowed to continue talking to this other person - as long as it didn't get physical (which it did not and I have no intention of betraying the trust of someone I love like that).

However, talking was enough to make me lose my head. Maybe it's the infatuation talking but I don't think I have ever met anybody else who can talk to me for hours about such deeply personal things and subjective experiences, etc. Even when my boyfriend and I just started going out, we did not have conversations of this calibre. This other person is incredibly perceptive, insightful and introspective and, even if we had all the time in the world, I don't think that'd be enough to talk  everything out.

Initially I thought that I should ensure that this other person stays a friend and nothing else. However, I am now so deeply in love with them, it makes me question whether or not it's worth losing my current relationship over. My boyfriend is wonderful and I love him very much - losing him would be extremely painful. But so would going back to the way things were before I met this new guy. Now that I've become aware that there is a person out there who can and frankly enjoys talking to me about feelings and experiences in such a way, I am not sure I'll be able to live without it. And staying friends with the other guy is out of the question now - we are both too infatuated with each other to ensure that we won't give into the awful temptation of cheating at some point - which, for obvious reasons, would be a terrible outcome. Plus, it would hurt to have to see him so often but as nothing more than a friend.

There is also a selfish voice inside of my head that keeps reminding me that I am young and don't have to make lifelong committments this early on in my life. In other words, one part of me simply wants to enjoy being so deeply in love again.

What should I do? Should I cut the other guy out for the sake of saving a relationship with the person whom I love and care very much about (but unfortunately am not in love with anymore)? Or should I throw everything away and take a leap of faith with this new guy?

Thank you in advance.",relationship_advice

so like i said we broke up around 6 months ago and about 2 months after we broke up we started seeing each other again and engaged a friends with benefits type of thing. like yes i, and probably her, still had feelings so and when my ex realised that i was still gonna get upset if she got a boyfriend at the time of seeing me she got angry.

so what was basically happening was she would ring me when she was free and id come round. so instead of idk, not messing with my head, my ex starts telling me ""oh [name of someone i trusted while i was with her] is trying to get with me"" and ""oh [another person i trusted] keeps asking me go round his."" and this would just continue like okay i get ppl are gonna speak to her and i accept that but like why tell me ygm?

it wasnt just when we were broken up though she did it while we were together too. i keep thinking its to get a reaction out of me or make me feel jealous but shes always be adamant that she isnt.

so what was the point in telling me about all the lads she thinks are fit and the ones who want to shag her if she doesnt want a reaction. its just she knew full well that itd upset me but O_o.

My relationship with my fiancée has been going on for almost 4 years now and we have spent the past year long distance. With her religious background it makes visits difficult. That's all you need to know about that

We fully intend to marry one another and we've been discussing it for a long time and we already decided on a small wedding with direct family and close friends only. My parents are aware of this. The major reason for having the wedding so soon is to make the process of visiting one another easier during my final year of studying (2020) and allowing us to actually be together inbetween semesters and during holidays. It puts a lot of emotional burden on the relationship to be far away from each other after having spent so much time together.

Today, however, my cousin informed the family of his engagement party in December (muslim/indian thing). This causes a bit of trouble because the rest of the family is not aware of the fact that I intend to move my relationship forward. Now comes the part where I seek advice. Should I inform the rest of my family soon considering my cousin and even my parents as well as his might think I'm taking his spotlight (he's the golden child of the family for reasons I don't even know)?

 I don't have the best relationship with my parents due to not being raised by them directly and they've told me that marrying is up to me and they can't stop me from doing it. That being said, they're also not happy about it either because of my age. Should I just go ahead and just leave them out, or just figure everything out with my fiancée and her mum and invite my parents as well? 

I'm not looking for judgement here, but rather just which possible roads I could take moving forward. I know none of this is conventional, but these are the cards my fiancée and I have been dealt and we want to make the best of the situation at hand and start building on a future and our careers together.",relationship_advice

This part is my fault, so I'm seriously to blame as well. After a while we get kind of real, and she tells me to tell her what to do. After confirming, but still ""role-playing"", she meant sexually. 

I couldn't act on it so I told her I didn't want to do it anymore. We ended the flirting and I feel bad about how we left off.

943,e69erp,MrCosmos360,1575508320.0,1,I (M16) want to confess my feelings to a girl (F16) who will probably reject me,"When I started school, I met a new girl which looked good and was generally nice. I wanted to meet her, but I didn’t see any chances until my school bench was assigned right in front of hers (Context: In my school you are in a classroom the entire semester, and teachers assign you a specific bench). I started to meet her more, and she talked to me too. Eventually, some weeks after, I invited her to the cinema (First time in my life I have ever invited a girl to something) She agreed, but said that “just as friends”. I agreed too, I wanted to meet her more and perhaps in the future she would change her mind. 

Everything went extremely well, we talked and had fun, I had a lot of hope. Then I found out she liked one friend of mine, and that hurted me, but he didn’t like her back, and at one point she told a friend that she doesn’t like him anymore. 

Eventually, everything continued ok. I talked to her, she would talk to me, I would help her, she would help me too, everything was very cool again. Until one day, I was impatient. I made a “plan” with another friend: He would tell her that I like her “without my consent or approval” and ask her what she feels about me. 

Everything went kinda like I expected to: She said “he’s kind, I don’t know...” and another time she said “I don’t know, he hasn’t said anything”. I continued everything like it was, being very kind and even kinda flirting sometimes. I have to admit, I hated this. I literally didn’t know what she truly felt: She said those things to my friend, but acted normally with me.  

At one point, my friend out of nowhere told me that she said that she wouldn’t be with me as something more. I was devastated: What in the actual fuck happened? Everything was cool from my perspective. I didn’t trust my friend this time, and continued to be like I was before with her. Now, the doubts with myself start: “What if she never liked me?” “No, I still have a chance” “What did I do wrong?” “I really like her, she is very kind towards me, I can’t give up, he must be lying” “She already knows that I like her and she’s still very nice towards me, is there still hope?” I exhausted myself for like two weeks with those thoughts, but everything was the same with her. 

At one point, my friend tells me to stop,  that it isn’t worth it. I just agree, and try to convince myself to stop and move on, but I couldn’t, even if I told myself that she doesn’t love me a single bit. She still wanted to speak with me sometimes and even at one point she asked me if I was ok. This was horrible, I was hopeful again. I didn’t back off after this, and continued, but this time the thoughts were still there: “She isn’t showing anything, but you are, and she knows, stop” and at the same time “You need to try harder to achieve this”. 

Then, my friend told me again that she talked with her and she said “I don’t like him, and I will never be  anything with him”. This time, I partially believed it. “Partially” because my dumb ass still wants to try because she was still the same with me. So I had an idea: Tell her what I feel. But at the same time, why? If I already know the answer. 

All my other friends tell me to do it even if I know the answer, but the only friend who doesn’t want me to do it is the one I mentioned before. 

I really don’t know. I keep asking to myself: “What if she DOES like you?” “What if she is lying to your friend?”. I am not sure what the hell is happening with myself and also with my relationship with her, but I don’t know completely how to stop all of this.  I want to be in peace, but I also want to be with her. 

Another things to consider: I am terrified to ruin my relationship with her. I am afraid that if I tell her, she will back off, even if she knows that I like her. And if I don’t do it, I’m afraid it won’t be the same after we enter school again; That she will stop liking me (if she does like me) over time and I will regret that I didn’t confess my feelings in the proper time.

TL;DR: I started liking a girl in school. I get to meet her, do fun stuff, have hope. I discover she likes someone else, but after some time she stops, so I continue. I ask my friend to ask her what does she feel without her knowing I’m behind this, and she says to my friend that “she doesn’t know” if she wants to be with me continuously. One day, she says “no”. I have a lot of second thoughts but still continue, until one day I had the idea to confess my feelings to her to stop all of this, but I’m still unsure if I should do it because I’m afraid it will ruin everything I worked on with her and also a fear of regretting it if I don’t do it.",relationship_advice

945,e69dc6,5thfloordropout,1575508146.0,0,"I, 18 (M), have created this plan to get my best friend of 6 years 19 (F) to like me","So my best friend and I recently got together for the first time in a month or so as she goes to college and I work for the time being. We talked at our favorite local restaurant about her boy troubles and how this dude she was talking to cut her off abruptly, even though they had planned out their entire winter break together. So me being the good friend I am, I was like well I’ll take you on a “date”. So we are going to see Christmas Lights, if you’re from GA, you know what I’m talking about. 

Well as the night went on I noticed more social cues that she was giving off that she doesn’t do normally, like looking into my eyes more when I was talking or even leaning in more as well and she even hugged me, and for her, she never goes out and just hugs someone unless she’s greeting them. So it’s was a little odd but, the hug definitely through me for a loop.

So as we are leaving a decide to finally end all of her boy drama and I’m going to take her on a date date. Everything is paid for, tickets dinner, I even bought her a NICE ASS necklace. The over all goal for the night is to let her see what having a real relationship is like. What having a ,for the time, real “boyfriend” is like. Then at the end of it all when we get back, I’m just gonna ask, “Was this the best night you’ve had?” If she gives me a yes my response will be, “This is what you should have, nights like these. This is wha having a boyfriend is like. This is what having me as boyfriend is like. I’m not asking you to go out with me or anything, all I’m asking for is a chance. A chance to make you feel like you’re the most special girl in the world, with me.” 

I’ve gone through all the scenarios in my head and even if she says no, I know for a fact that based off our friendship and how close we are in general, this won’t effect our friendship if she says no. In fact, now it allows herself to know what having a date like this is like.

Now what I’m asking from y’all is, is there anything else I should do, more parts I should add? I’m just trying to make this the best night for the both of us. Thank y’all and imma let y’all know how this goes. The date is on the 20 🤪🤪🤪",relationship_advice

I’ll keep this short. I’m 24 and my bf has one really immature friend, he’s lost his job from fucking up he’s hurt his leg from being so drunk he fell and broke it and he’d rather pay for sex and contracted an std than just wait till he’s found his own happiness. 

I really don’t like him, recently I went to my bf’s and his friend well call him Jamie. Jamie text him and said hey I wanna play fifa, come on now. My bf said no I can’t I’m out and his response was “gf again” and my bf said well yeah I told you I’m with her. We got back and he asked me if he could go play and it was more of a I’m gonna go anyway. Which was fine as I was heading to bed anyway, but his mate kept asking. 

He told me his mate said to him look at that woman over there would you cheat on your gf for £200 with that woman. Which I was like erm okay that’s not cool really. But I let it slide. 

Jamie encourages my bf to go with him to strip clubs after a night out mainly so Jamie can go get laid. 

Our anniversary is this week and Jamie text my bf saying wanna go cinema and go get new clothes with me. And my bf said no I have plans and Jamie’s reply was “gf again” I got kinda mad at this as small as it is  because his friend is clingy and it’s disrespectful toward me to encourage my bf to look at tits and do shit for money. And I never got mad about the previous stuff but today took the absolute p*** mainly outta me 

My bf tries to re assure me and not stesss but Jamie’s comments are starting to piss me off",relationship_advice

She said yes and asked what MY number was and said she’d text me. This confused me because that’d never happened to me before where i ask a girl out and she asks for my number. I’ve heard about on youtube videos and other forums and it usually followed with that OP saying that means they probably aren’t interested.

I,"Recap of my last post: I ghosted my close friend like 3 days ago (like we both have similar personal issues and we both helped each other just by talking). It was kinda ""had"" to be done but after that I felt like the shittiest person ever and that whole day jsut sucked. So I posted that on Reddit cuz I wanted ppl to tell me I am a fucking terrible person and etc..I wanted to feel more bad about myself 

Update: in the end I coudnt resist not talking to him. The same day I found out he tried to contact me thru like 4 diff platforms and I just accepted one of the requests and we talked about it. I was shocked to see he wasn't mad at all. He said he was crying and was upset the whole afternoon and worrying about me cuz of the personal issues. 
I did say a srry wasn't worth all of wat he went thru that day. But he said it's okay and I went along with that..

RECENT UPDATE: it was okay at the moment, we were talking as usual but recently we haven't been talking as much. I rlly feel like it's cuz of wat I did..maybe he was worried at first cuz he wasn't thinking straight  but now that he actually thinks about it might get him angry? Idk. Even b4 it wasn't like we talked 24/7 I get it he might be busy and I am busy too sometimes but I just can't help but think wat I did is gonna be having an effect on our friendship. If I ask him directly he will think I am trying to end our communication or he might find it annoying??

The kind of news that a boyfriend never wants to hear in a relationship. The girl that I shared the deepest connection with decided to break up with me. It’s not because she was sick of me or our relationship, but she’s doing it out of respect for her parents. She didn’t want to date in secret anymore because it’s taking a toll on her mentally and she couldn’t afford to strain our relationship further. Tears are streaming down my eyes as I type this up but I feel like I’ve just lost the love of my life. She was my soulmate - she took good care of me, she comforted me during my darkest days, she understood me inside and out, she loved me for who I was but most importantly, she loved me more than anyone has ever loved me. I spent the entire night crying, staring blankly at the ceiling and constantly blaming myself for everything that has happened. Bearing in mind, this is my first ever breakup so it hurts even more. I don’t deserve this at all and neither does she. I feel so lost right now and I’m starting to think that nothing ever goes right for me, no matter how hard I try. I’ve been wanting to send her a message to see how she’s doing but I’m too afraid to do so because I fear that any sort of interaction with her in the meantime would trigger something bad.

954,e696sf,throwawayaccount9697,1575507338.0,1,My(m23) girlfriend(f22) wants to be friend after being together for 3 years. And is not sure if we might get back together in the future.,"My(m23)  girlfriend(f22) wants to be just friends now. We have been together for the past 3 years and lived with each other for the past 2 years. We are in medical school and it’s our last stretch. We came to a new city in January for studies and rotations. where I made new friends which I hung out with a lot but I didn’t include her. I was sort of putting her aside and that’s my fault. I only saw her when I got home and I didn’t try to go out with her or even just spend time with her either. She was alone in those 4 months and tried to get my attention. Around may she started to hang out with a new guy friend( let’s call him pat). she spent a lot of time with him. I didn’t mind it at all because we are both faithful to each other and I love her. We have sacrificed a lot for each other for the past few years and we came out stronger each time. Around July she slept in his house with other friends. Apparently they get drunk and they would crash at pats place. I was fine with it but I realized at that moment how distant we were and I knew that it was my fault. So I started to make it right by spending as much time together as we can. But she started to hang out with him much more alone. She would bring him to out place so they can chill. I could never get time to spend with her. I got annoyed after he put up notes on the wall telling me what to do. For example: I had been procrastinating about doing the dishes for a day and they both came home and he wrote a note “ clean the dishes, she isn’t your maid”. I had a talk with her about this and it’s rude but she defended his actions and started to argue how I never did dishes. She started to slowly throw parties at our house and get drunk with him and dance erotically and even offered to have sex with him in front of me. My heart broke that night. She has been getting drunk with her every weekend. This is the first time i saw her drunk with him. She and pat completely destroyed the apartment and it reeked with alcohol. After that incident we started to argue a lot and she would spend her entire day and night with him. I wouldn’t see her home for 3- 4 days. Even if I did I would try to talk to her but she would just ignore or argue how I wasn’t there for her in January. I felt horrible because she was right. I did ignore her. So I felt like I deserved this and continued on trying to fix this. Our lease was ending and we had to move. I finally got her attention to talk about this and I asked if she is willing to let pat go from her life for us to live again together. I was determined that we would last. But she said she wouldn’t chose me or him. So she suggested we live alone for a while. I would do anything for her, I love her to much to let go. She was there for my when I lost my family, she was the only light I saw. We even promised to get married to each other one day after medical school. So I wanted to try everything. I agreed to live separately and work on our relationship. She needed financial support to lease out an apartment so I lend her some money. Later I realized she rented an apartment in the same place where pat lives. So I went to her one day and just cried and told her that I made a mistake ignoring her for 4 months and that if ur making me feel ur pain. I feel it. Just let’s start again. Then she said she isn’t ready to be in a relationship with anyone. And that she said that she chooses me  over pat and that hopefully we can be friends. In the future when she is ready to be in a relationship, she would try again with me.  So I initially agreed to this. I was fine with it since pat isn’t in the loop. And if this made us stronger, I would do anything. She started to spend even less time with me. I would see her once a week. Every time I call her she is busy. And once I heart pats voice in the back. I am just heart broken, I have no idea what to do. I feel like I’m falling in this black hole and can’t seem to get out.  I confront her about pat but she keeps on saying that we aren’t together so it doesn’t matter if he was with her. She also accuses me for not trusting her word when she said she chose me over pat.  I love her to much to let go, but it seems like I have lost her completely. I have no idea what to do next. I ignored my friend after June so I can be with my girlfriend as much as I can. So eventually my friends started to let go. I have no idea what to do next. I want her back in my life. I regret the ignoring her in January so much.

955,e696nt,waytoolatetoreddit,1575507319.0,3,I’m (21m) almost certain one of my closest friends (21m) is now fooling around with my very recent FWB (20f) and I’m thinking about cutting both of them out of my life,"Over the summer I had a FWB situation with a girl that I went to high school with. We had mutual friends, I had known of her and after high school we got to know each other better hanging out at a mutual friend’s parties during holidays and summers. The mutual friend that threw the parties set me up on a blind date with her. I had no idea she was interested in me, I was told there were times she was flirting with me but I’m an oblivious dumbass who never picked it up.  After our third date she said she wasn’t interested in a relationship due to being in a really bad one a year ago, but said she was still interested in going on dates and fooling around. I was all for it and it was a pretty great summer. Once summer ended she went back to her college which is about 3 hours away from where we live and told me to come visit her. As far as I knew she still had intentions to continue what we were doing.

A few weeks after she left my friend and I were hanging out, we’re both pretty busy with school and work so we only hang out maybe once or twice a month. He told me he was planning on going to visit her in two weeks and asked if I wanted to road trip with him. I wasn’t able to get the time off from work since it was pretty short notice plus I wanted it to just be me and her when I eventually went to visit. He had about the same amount of interaction I had with said girl excluding my fling with her over the summer. I was planning on going three weeks after him and thought nothing of it. The girl and I hadn’t really kept in touch much during the first month of school due to us both being busy and me not wanting to bother her if she was doing homework or something like that but I did text her before my friend visited and told her I wasn’t able to get time off to go with him and I was planning on coming a few weeks later. A few days before I was coming up I asked if everything was still cool for that weekend just to make sure nothing came up and it would be a bad time to come. She said no it was still good but laid it on me that she thought it would be best if I came up just as a friend and we probably shouldn’t fool around anymore because we hadn’t talked much since she left, that she valued the friendship we built over the summer, and it wouldn’t feel right to her to continue. She said she understood if I didn’t want to come now because of that, obviously it wasn’t the only reason I wanted to see her but I had really missed the intimate connection we had and was looking forward to it again that weekend. I told her I understood and that I still wanted to come. I still had a good time that weekend even though nothing happened. I asked her if she was coming back to our hometown before thanksgiving break and she said she would be back for a couple of days in a few weeks. 

The few weeks come and I completely forgot that’s when she said she was coming. I didn’t realize it until one day I was bored and opened up the Snapchat maps. Both her and my friend show their location on it and they were both at his house. I was super confused, I thought maybe he accidentally left something there when he came to visit and she was returning it or maybe there was a group hang out going on and they were the only ones with their locations on. Or the most obvious answer but I wasn’t going to go jumping to conclusions yet. Halloween comes and him and I see each other at a party for the first time in a while, I don’t mention anything. A couple weeks later I check the snap maps again and I see that he’s back in her college town. Okay I thought, it’s getting really possible that they could be hooking up now. I still wasn’t going to say for sure. During the summer I asked her if she was going to be in town for thanksgiving break, she said she wasn’t she was gonna be in a different state to visit family. So a couple of days before thanksgiving I see a Snapchat story of her driving back home excited for break. That night I see that she’s at his place again and the next morning her icon is still there until I see she’s at the airport. She spent her only night that she’s in town at my friends house. There’s no way that they aren’t fooling around now.

A little backstory on my friend, a couple of years ago he started dating another one of my friends ex’s right after they had broken up. They weren’t close, nothing like him and I are. I eventually decided to keep it a secret from my other one with the thought process that it was his ex’s responsibility to tell him about them not mine or my other friends who got caught up in the mess. The friend who got broken up with found out and wouldn’t talk to me or other friends for a few months. Eventually that friend and I worked it out and we’re cool again, but he doesn’t talk to my other friend. They got back together a year later after my friend broke up with her. So he has a history of messing around with friends former interests and it appears that it has now happened to me although in a not as serious situation. I still feel hurt and betrayed by him, I’ve kinda always been jealous of him. He’s a muscular, fit guy who works out all the time and goes on dating apps and gets with a lot of girls. I’m an average looking guy who’s only had two relationships and this girl was only the third I’ve been with, it had been two years since I had gotten intimate with anyone until this girl so I don’t have that much experience. I just feel like he could’ve left her alone you know? I’m not claiming she could only be with me but I feel he violated bro code. You really shouldn’t mess around with someone that one of your closest friends was with. Especially considering his body count is probably 5 or 6 times what mine is, he can literally get about anyone. I’m not completely positive if he’s the reason why she broke off our thing but I’m pretty sure that’s why. I struggle with confidence issues a lot and I was finally starting to get some back but now I’m probably at one of my lowest points in a long time.

I still haven’t seen him since Halloween, but I’m thinking about confronting him personally then cutting him out of my life. I just don’t think I can stay friends with him after this. I’m not mad at him but I just wished it didn’t have to come to this. I don’t blame her either, if I was in her shoes I wouldn’t definitely choose him over me but I think it’d be best if I cut her out too. Should I just let it happen and get over the fact that she’d rather have him then me? If not, is there anything I could do that might save our friendship? I’ve never dealt with anything like this before and I don’t really know what to do. Any advice would really be appreciated, thanks.",relationship_advice
956,e695y0,throwawayradorito,1575507225.0,2,"My [22F] boyfriend [21M] of 1.5 years broke up with me, and i don’t know if/how i should let him go","Wow i don’t know where to start. So my boyfriend broke up with me. It was not a decision that either one of us wanted, but i basically said i wasn’t strong enough to do it, so he said he would bc something in our relationship needed to change. 

We were each other’s first boyfriend/girlfriend, and he has become the person i am closest to over the course of our relationship. We never had any one issue that caused problems, it just seems that we are both very hard headed and can’t see eye to eye on a good number of things. 

We were both brought up in VERY different households. My family is very close and i am fortunate in having loving parents and a brother and sister who will always be close to me. His family is pretty much the opposite. With his dad having passed away young, his mom remarrying someone who hurt more than helped his family, he definitely hasn’t had the easiest upbringing. 

My sister and boyfriend were friends prior to us dating, but a recent event has spoiled their relationship possibly forever (a story for a different time). A different unfortunate even occurred when my dad saw very...personal... texts my bf was sending to me, so my boyfriend feels very tense and uncomfortable when interacting with my family. 

The night we broke up, it was very emotional. We were both crying and he was in a very dark place. I was scared to leave him alone, but i also was leaving on a family trip not even an hour later so it was extremely bad timing.

We texted the next day, but i was unable to call due to being with my family and trying to keep a happy face on. He basically said i was putting too much pressure on him to be something he’s not. With school and money and his own family issues, he couldn’t handle me asking him for basic things in addition to that. 

I did a lot for him. He doesn’t have a car, so i drove him everywhere. He has dogs which i looked after as if they were my own. Money is tight (we are broke college students), but i paid for food and other things bc my parents help me out a lot. I ready did everything that i could to try to make his life easier, but i think me doing that added pressure to him. 

I am heartbroken and the day after we broke up, he told me he was going to redownload tinder to boost his confidence bc it was at an all time low. In a twisted way i understood, bc i felt like i has caused him so much pain and didnt want to cause more, but it also hurt a lot. Intimate sex means a lot to me, and our physical relationship meant a lot to him as well, but he was also able to have casual meaningless sex before we were together, whereas i could not. 

Since then he has said he wants to be friends so that we could stay in each other’s lives, but that the intimate part of our relationship has to stop for now. I don’t want to lose him, so i agreed, but it was killing me to still be in contact, but also be so distant.

Friends have told me that he doesn’t care and obviously doesn’t want to get back together and that the tinder situation means he probably wasn’t happy sexually, but our sex life was incredible, possibly the best part about us towards the end there so i know that is not a factor. 

I told him the other day that i did not want to have contact this week due to me not being able to distance myself, and it has helped but I’m still upset. We planned a trip to Canada for his birthday next month, and he mentioned maybe going as friends. Although i realize it’s probably a terrible idea, i can’t help but still want to go and experience it with him. 

I’m just unsure what to do next. I have finally made peace with us being apart, I’m just not sure what to do. If he is sleeping with other people, i don’t think i would be able to do friendship, but i also don’t want to lose him. I want what’s best for him, but i am unable to fully let him go because i still feel like we have the potential to be our best together.

959,e694ou,calicocatz18,1575507048.0,1,Is it possible to experience trauma from an ex?,"I would like to start off by saying that I was not in an emotionally, nor physically abusive relationship. 

Trigger warning ⚠️- mental health, suicide, depression 

My ex (M/22) and I (F/21) were together for a year in a semi LDR (1.5 hour train journey). About six months in, he began experiencing deep depression. He would confide in me over text as to how dark he was feeling, and I remember always being overcome with immense anxiety and helplessness. So, I would rush over to him on the train to try and help. 

This depression remained on and off for the rest of the relationship. Each time, my response being the same. Each time, I felt more and more hopeless and worried I would lose him because I knew he had suicidal tendencies. 

Things really came to a head in spring. He became increasingly worse, and so did I. I would become so fearful when he didn’t reply to a text as I thought he was dead- not an exaggeration. I believed this at the time because I knew that he was capable of seeing it though. 

He broke up with me, understandably so. 
I was of course devastated but have recovered reasonably well since I knew it had to happen. 

But what I am now dealing with is an intense shift in my own character. I went from being anxious and caring (possibly overbearing) to cold and apathetic. I now find it hard to trust people, confide in them, allow them to confide in me- such triggers elicit an immense fight or flight panic response. Of course, I now realise that this is wildly uncharacteristic. 

So my question is- is it possible that I am experiencing some sort of trauma from my severely depressed, suicidal ex? If so, what do I do? It appears I come to moments of realisation that I am acting cold and distant, and try to be warm and caring, but then revert to this coldness out of nowhere. 

TL;DR - is it possible that a mentally unwell ex boyfriend could have provoked a trauma response where my personality shifts?

I feel like it’s stopping me meeting new people and a potential new group of friends for when we go out clubbing but also feel really bad that she seems upset about me going. I have tried talking it through but she won’t see from my perspective.

Also something that may make it worse is that one of my guy friends that is going has a gf that is close with my gf, and he is extremely flirty. This leads to trust issues in their relationship that also affects my relationship causing my gf to worry and doubt.",relationship_advice

965,e6928u,ThrowRAInsecureidiot,1575506747.0,0,I [M20] am insecure and shameful about being a guy. My girlfriend [F25] is sweet and doesn't have a hateful bone in her body but I worry she looks down on me for being male.,"I'm a twenty year old man who has been insecure about being male for quite a long time. I'm not gay or trans, just a typical straight guy. This is partially why I feel like such shit in regards to how I feel - Like I should fit in a box or not worry about this. 

Anyway, I've felt since I can remember that women are better than men. I've felt that women are usually more peaceful, less violent, more supportive, smarter, just better at being normal and human. I've felt that men are typically the opposite and uncivilized. This leads to me feeling shameful about myself and that I'm male. I know it's illogical but it's extremely difficult on me and hurts me. The prospect of being left out for being male hurts bad and it kind of feels deserved. 

That leads into my girlfriend. So sweet and kind to everyone. Nothing that would logically make me believe she hates men or looks down on them. But there are some things she's done that make me think otherwise. She's a feminist which I have no problem with - I'm a left wing guy and I feel like feminism is great. She's also very into girl power and jokes about being a lesbian because she likes girls so much. These are small things that I don't think are worthy of such scrutiny but it's eating away at me. 
 
So first, we play a game with a large character select screen. She had all the women sectioned off with the titles ""Girls ❤"" or ""Girls :)"". All the male characters are either in a section called ""Boys :("" and ""Down with the patriarchy"". I noticed this and eventually told her about my insecurity. She changed it to ""Boys :P"" so now I just feel like I'm manipulating her and making her hide her real opinions. Being a typical man and forcing my will so to say. 

Secondly she's used the bowl of m&ms analogy before (Why stay with men if they have a chance of hurting you. You wouldn't eat out of a bowl of m&ms if you knew a few of them were poisoned.), and she browses tumblr and I've seen her like things that say that. I've told her again about my insecurities and how I feel awful about this and she denies agreeing with it. Saying they're bad feminists. But again I feel like I'm forcing her to say this. 

I know it isn't much proof but it's still enough to set off my shame and insecurity. I feel really awful about the things I've mentioned. I feel like men do nothing but hurt and that because I'm a man I'm part of it and that I'm a terrible person for it. I feel left out and shunned because of it even though I have no proof or examples about that except for when my gf and our mutual friend, a woman, went out to pick her bridesmaids dress for next year, and I wasnt invited and told it isnt a guy thing when I asked to go. 

I'm more feminine that most guys and really sensitive so it hurts to get lumped in with a gender I feel is bad. At the same time I feel like it's right and that I am bad for being male. I feel like that's what my gf secretly thinks for a stupid reason. She's reassured me that it's not the case but now I just feel manipulative for it. I hate it so much. I love my girlfriend so this kills me. Please help and give advice.",relationship_advice
966,e691wm,ThrowRAbirthdayy,1575506693.0,1,My (F23) friend (F22) planned “my” birthday outing and I’m not sure what to do.,"So, I don’t normally do much for my birthday because I have friends and family located all over the state/country, it’s just too hard to get them all in one place. I still like to enjoy my birthday though. I usually just hang out with my sister and have a nice day with her. But this year my one friend mentioned that she wanted to do something with me this year. So I thought cool, I’m open to whatever and just let her take over the plans. 

That was a few weeks ago, so the other day I just wanted to check in as my birthday is coming up in 3 weeks, and I wanted to know what’s going on. She said that we’re gonna go out to dinner and then to a few bars but everything is going on later in the night (10/12ish).  At this point I’m like cool that all sounds nice. But then she reminds me that it’s her SO’s birthday the literal next day, and it’s their 21st birthday (hence why everything is happening near midnight, so they can drink). She then quickly mentions to me that it’s not just a few people, it’s all her SO’s friends and family and then “us” (meaning me and her). It finally clicked. She’s not close with her SO’s family so she’s been planning to bring me along with her as her company for the night... I’m going to be spending my birthday celebrating someone else’s birthday that I’m not even friends with because my friend doesn’t want to be alone. She never even asked if I wanted any of my friends to come. 

I know I should have asked her to clarify who was coming rather than just assuming otherwise. But I feel a little hurt by this and like I just always come second to her, I don’t know how to explain it exactly. However, I kinda feel bad if I just leave her alone, but I was hoping to spend time with my sister as I haven’t seen her in about 5 months since she moved for work. I guess I’m just not sure what to do. Am I overreacting about all this? Should I just go? 

TL;DR - Friend planned “my” birthday outing, didn’t tell me it was actually for her SO and their family/friends. Just wants me there for company as she’s not close to any of them. Don’t know if I should go.",relationship_advice
967,e690uw,overisan,1575506568.0,1,How/should I (21F) break up with my boyfriend (21M)?,"Me and my current boyfriend are about to hit our 1 year anniversary. Ever since the beginning of our relationship, I honestly kind of felt a little forced into it. He is the type to fall hard FAST, and I was still getting to know him. I did like him though so I went along with it to see where it would go. I am very back and forth with how I feel about our relationship. Some days I am just so happy to be with him, but then the next day I am questioning everything. We had some issues in the past about him ""cheating"" (talking to other girls while we were talking in the beginning) and it made me lose almost all my trust for him.

He claimed that we were dating around September as he was talking to them in November. When I said that to him he now is saying we weren't official until end of December so it's okay. He did sincerely apologize for it but ever since then I haven't looked at him the same. This eventually led us to break up for a couple of weeks and during that I hung out with a dude I have known for a while and pretty much fell in love with him the first time I met him (about 2 years ago). Once I got into this current relationship I let my feelings go with him but after seeing him again more recently, all my feelings came back. He had talked about us dating which I think I would be happier in that relationship, but he seems non-committal and don't know if he's serious about it. I am just feeling very confused and stuck and need some advice on what I should do :/.  I know what the obvious answer is but I don't want to ruin everything with my current boyfriend if it's  not worth it.

I am also very scared to break up with him if I have to. I am a very non confrontational person so I don't even know how to bring it up and I just know how much it would hurt him. He is very in love with me but I just don't think we're on the same page.",relationship_advice

She broke down completely and begged me not to leave her. She wouldn't let me leave her house until I agreed to just ""go on a break for a while.""

Our relationship started 8 months ago and we were friends for about 3 years before that. 

The whole relationship was very hard for me, she was/is emotionally very chaotic and manipulative. I had to wrestle a razor away from her while she was trying to slit her wrists in my bathroom about 2 months into our relationship and have taken care of her many times when she has felt suicidal. 

I thought I could help her and be a good support for her, but it's too much for me.

I felt like more of a fatherly figure than a boyfriend. Always having to ask her to behave, always having to take care of her, always having to de-escalate her fights with her family. She threw tantrums when I told her no on things and definitely took advantage of my kindness.

Now her mom is texting me asking me to check up on her and telling me I'm basically an asshole.

I do care about her a lot but I'm just not down for the chaos and drama. She is my first serious girlfriend so I havent been down this road before.

969,e68zb8,rA-threwaway,1575506365.0,1,"In a committed relationship, have a LD one sided love, should I confess my feelings?","Title sums it up.

I'm in a committed relationship. But I'm not happy. We are both financially dependent on each other so neither of us can really make the move to get away from each other.

There's a guy I've known since I was 16, he was 18 at the time we started talking. We bonded through an online forum but became very good friends in the 6 years since then.

I love him. Deeply. Indescribably. I have admitted these feelings to myself alone, no one else, for at least a year and a half now. If we were in closer proximity (we live on different sides of the continent) I would go for it. After having been burned in LDRs in the past, and knowing he could never commit to that (his words), I have never confessed my feelings.

The burden of them lying squarely on my shoulders, having confided this to no one is growing tiresome. I want to confess how I feel to him. At the same time, I know it's a shitty move considering I am in a relationship (he is single, for the record.) That's mostly been my deterrent. That and the fact I don't want him to perceive me differently. If possible, I want to remain his friend if nothing else. 

It was never a grooming situation, for the record, he has always seen me as a little annoying sister figure in his life. If I explained how I know that, I'd give away too much information so please just take my word.

There has also been no emotional cheating or cheating in any variety, for that matter.

If I shouldn't confess, what should I do to deal with this feeling? I couldn't distance myself from him, because I would hate to. After all, he is one of my best friends and I don't want to ghost him for no reason.

In this group there is a guy that I've been thinking a lot about lately and I think I like him. Throughout the night he has admitted to being romantically interested in someone, he almost only talked to me the whole night, he asked if I was interested in someone, and I freaked out and said I don't know because I felt if I said yes I would have to tell him who but it's him. We agree on a lot of things, for example how we want a relationship to be. We have a lot in common but some interesting things that aren't too. I actually feel like he's the perfect match for me.

Even if I'm right, I can't do anything about it because every time it I'm close to being in a relationship I freeze and can't go forward so I end up going back to being single and I tell myself that I'm happier single. Some time later I'll repeat the circle, looking for a relationship opportunity, then backing out before I commit. 

I'm so tired of this circle but I'm stuck. I have never been a serious relationship, and I keep making my inexperience my poor excuse to my behaviour.

971,e68yl2,homeaway4home,1575506276.0,2,40+F has lost herself after endless engagement and wondering is there hope for the future? Emotional abuse," 

My fiancee and I have been together for over 5 years now. And he swept me off my feet. He even convinced me to move to his city, quit my career and allow him to support me until I got my own consulting business going. This was after 6 months of knowing him. I saw the red flags but the exterior was SO convincing…that I didn’t listen.

I moved and quickly saw CONTROL like I had never seen before. I was always the breadwinner in my previous marriage. I was a go getter and had NEVER allowed anyone to control me or my finances. Well, quite quickly he was asking me why I needed a manicure….or why I needed to buy new make up or get my hair done. This was RIGHT AWAY. So, I started getting clients FAST> I was terrified. I couldn’t live with this monster…like this.

But, because of how I moved there…he just took all of my client checks and said they were covering my expenses etc. Except within 6 months I was back to being on track to making 100k+ again. 

He was taking all of it. And he only gave me a credit card to use. Long story short, he even went to the court and got a common law marriage certificate in our state so he could tell his employer that I should be on his insurance. (free). He didn’t want to pay….so, a few months after this…..he got very, very angry because he knew I was starting to hide paychecks. I told him that the client just was slow to pay etc but he didn’t buy it.  

At this point I had access to the bank account, but after I just deposited 10k into the account for the month, he moved it to his OTHER account and only left 2k n there. We had a horrible fight and we were traveling. We were in a hotel. He left me that night. He suggested I had called the police on him (which I didn’t) and he left me. He cut the credit card and went no contact. He left me with nothing.  

I had no money, no credit card…except the 2k that was still int he account and I called his parents and they said he was with them and they couldn’t help. To GO AWAY. NEVER talk to him or them again. He filed an ANNULMENT and got it on a legal technicality! 

I kept begging…I didn’t understand what happened. And yes, we were fighting, but he left me with NOTHING. He then sent my clothing Cash On Delivery to my lawyer’s office because I didn’t have an address. I had no money! 

I borrowed from family and after a salary advance from a terrific client …I was back on my feet within 30 days.  The CRAZY thing is I kept begging him to talk to me. To forgive me. To take me back. I loved him …how could he do this to me? I was HEARTBROKEN.

Then 7 weeks later….he came back. He asked to see me…wanted to talk to me. Missed me. Loved me. And sent me songs. And I. WENT. BACK.

He promised he would marry me again the RIGHT WAY. That was 3 years ago. The only way I went back was if I could keep my own lease paid and I controlled my own money. So I have all of that.  But, our lives are not better. He is horrible to me. He screams at me. He says he loves me and wants to be with me forever, but on thanksgiving I told him I wanted to tell family about the wedding date HE set and he said he would deny it …and I would be told to leave his family gathering if I said anything.

Reality is…it’s December 4 2019. Just before the holidays. We had HORRIBLE fights over thanksgiving. He was ruthless to me. And I’m traveling for work and trying to get the strength to just not return. But, everytime I think about it… I become this disgusting victim who feels not good enough. Never going to meet anyone… disaster of a person who can never make anyone happy.

I have also been drinking far too much. My therapist says it’s self medicating but I’m scared…WHAT IF I am an alcoholic? What if I lose everything? I feel like the relationship at least gives me some stability. yes, it’s awfully painful at times….but it’s stable.  

Then I have visions of him at his xmas parties without me. He has women fall all over him. HE LOOKS LIKE A CATCH. He has a great job (no savings though) and he works out twice a day….hot car. You know the type. And I’ll be the woman who drinks herself to death because I am never good enough.

Just needed to reach out tonight and ask for some advice. Should I just make it through the holidays? I just hate this whole BIG picture. It’s not pretty. My life is fading away. I drank a bottle and half of wine yesterday…. started at late lunch and didn’t really slow down. I feel horrible today. I just couldn’t take his rants and screaming. Also, the pain of realizing I’ve thrown away 5 years of my life…for a guy who everyone thinks is amazing but is really VERY emotionally abusive to me.  

Maybe we can fix things?  If I could be happier around him and ask less questions (that makes him very mad).... maybe it could work.  But I can't seem to forget the past...",relationship_advice
972,e68yfv,FirefliesArePretty,1575506259.0,137,My fiance (32M) wants to end a 10 year relationship because I (32F) gained weight (30lbs). Should I let him go or try to save the relationship?,"My fiance and I have been dating for 10 years, living together for 4 years, engaged for 2 years. We had a lot of good things in our relationship, but one issue we've had for years is how critical he is of both his own and my weight.

When we were 26-ish we actually broke up because he told me I needed to lose weight but I was actually happy with my body. For reference, I'm 5'4 and weighed about 138 lbs at the time and was going to power yoga 6 days a week. We ended up getting back together but I asked him not to comment on my body like that again.

Fast forward to 2 years ago when a few things happened. I began taking an anti-depressant, returned to school (while continuing to work full time) in order to change careers, and my cat got diagnosed with cancer. My stress levels sky-rocketed. Working full time, taking several science classes at once, attending endless vet visits, paying enormous amounts of money for surgeries and chemo etc. Needless to say, something had to give and I let working out fall by the wayside. I knew it wasn't ideal, but  I would rather get straight As and keep taking the anti-depressant to help keep my sanity even if both things meant I'd gain some weight.

Unfortunately, I gained more weight than I expected and now weigh about 170 lbs. My fiance was trying not to say anything because of our previous break up but was really unhappy about my weight gain and felt trapped. Eventually he told me how unhappy he was and now wants to end things.

The thing is, this time I do agree that I need to lose weight. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin and my doctor also recommended it. However, I don't *hate* my body or my decision to temporarily prioritize my career and mental health.  I am going to get back to a healthy weight but I'm not in a huge desperate rush to crash diet and do it ASAP. I don't know what to say to my fiance.

I hate that he cares more about my weight than I do and that while I was comfortable sacrificing some gym time for study time, he wasn't. What are some thoughts out there, especially from men? I know they are highly visual creatures and attractiveness is important, but at the same time shouldn't we be able to have a little wiggle room in a long term committed relationship? After all, if we were to get married, we'd get a little fatter and less attractive at some point right? If he is this uncomfortable with me gaining 30 lbs, do we even stand a chance against something more serious that may come up later in life (like if I get sick, pregnant etc.)

Anyone have any thoughts, advice, similar experiences?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Updates (12/5/19 1:45 pm PST)**

Thanks to all for responding, whether it's encouraging, sassy, confrontational or simply understanding. Overall, what rings most true from the responses is that neither one of us is a “bad” person, we're just not compatible and have different priorities. The best thing to do seems to break it off, get to a weight I’m personally comfortable with and find a person who finds me attractive at that weight. Rationally it makes sense. Emotionally, it just sucks to lose a partner of 10 years in order to do that.

It also seems like people are still responding and some are asking similar questions, so I figured I'd provide more info on the common themes/questions:

&#x200B;

* *Is my fiancé himself fit, super into fitness, a health      nut?* He does admirably put it      consistent work in the gym (20 mins, 3-4 days a week on his lunch breaks),      but he is absolutely not a ""health"" nut. For him, it's strictly      about the looks, rather than health. As long as the scale shows a certain      number, he couldn't care less about his diet or liver. He likes to drink      and his goal is to be able to indulge as much as possible and offset it by      going to the gym. On the weekends, I frequently try to get him out for a      hike but he prefers to play video games because he’s “put in enough effort      to maintain his weight” and doesn’t need the “extra exercise” and that I      should just go alone because I didn’t work out during the week like he      did. He did come with me a few times, but reluctantly so I felt guilty      instead of having fun.
* *I don't seem to care about my weight and health at all.*      Not exactly. It’s true that I      don't care much about *looks* but I      do care about *health* which is      why I was comfortable when I was 138 lbs which is on the higher end of the      healthy range for my body and am not comfortable now. I’m a type of person      whose interests come in waves. I pursue something for a couple of years      and then I like to switch it up, so I’ve been at all ends of the fitness      spectrum. For a period of 2 years, I was super into CrossFit. I got down      to 128 lbs and had a six pack and some sexy muscles going on. By the way,      back then my fiancé said my quads were too muscular and my ribs were      sticking out so he wasn’t exactly happy either. I thought I looked pretty      kick ass, but I realized it was not a lifestyle I wanted to pursue      forever. In order to look that way, fitness was ALL I had time for. I      worked out for about 2 hours a day 6 days a week and spent the rest of my      free time meal prepping. It was just a little too extreme for me in the      long term, not a permanent lifestyle for someone with my body type who      also wants to pursue additional passions outside of fitness. My goal now      is simply to get to a healthy BMI. I’m comfortable taking it slow without      getting all gung-ho again. I also want it to come from a healthy mindset.      My fiancé tends to use self-deprecation to motivate himself and I resent      that approach.  My self-worth is tied      to more things than only my looks which is why I think I’ve felt OK about      myself as a person at all weights and levels of muscularity. I have other      things going for me to be proud of.
* *It’s not OK to let yourself go in a long term relationship/marriage.* I absolutely agree, but letting yourself      go, in my mind, means being lazy, having no ambition and just sitting      around wasting time without trying to improve your life. I’ve been working      insanely hard for the last 2 years toward this career change which would      afford us a better life style. Most weekdays I woke up at 6 am and got      home around 10 or 11 pm after work, school, and volunteering (part of the      requirement for grad school applications). On the weekends, I would do      laundry, grocery shop, try to go for 1 hike (I now bring a dog from a      local shelter instead of my fiancé lol) and study (someone asked why I      need good grades, it’s because it takes above a 3.7 GPA to get admitted to      grad school programs I’m applying to). I think it would be disrespectful for      me to believe “I’ve let myself go” given all the hard work I’ve put in. It      would feel kind of like saying: that’s all really cute that you want to      have goals, but just don’t forget that your # 1 goal is to be pretty. In      my mind fitness is *one* of many      priorities in life, but it’s not THE priority in life. People aren’t born for      the purpose of being thin and attractive, there are so many other things      to do with your life. Sometimes, other things will come to the forefront      and I don’t think the world (or relationships) should end then. I guess,      that’s where my fiancé and I have mismatched priorities. \*sigh\*
* *Your fiance sounds terrible/He didn't love you/ Did he even try to help?*  I can assure you guys, he's a good person. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been with him for this long. I know for a fact he loved me (and still does) and I love him which is the reason I wrote this post, trying to see if anything would bring me hope that we can understand each other and work through this. I know I can and will lose the weight. What I don't know is if I can trust him to be happy with the same weight I'm happy with or if it's going to be an issue forever and ever which wouldn't be cool to anyone. Also as I begin my weight loss now, I would feel like he'd be waiting with abated breath, counting the pounds and the inches, getting upset over any setbacks which would just mess with my head. Also, yes he did try to help with the cat (he took and paid for half her visits), with my school, around the house (the man does all our dishes, amazing), and food prep. I can write more, but this is already a freaking novel-sized post and I can't believe some people have the patience to listen to me for this long.
* *Women care about looks too. They're not dating chubby guys under 6 feet tall.* You guys are right. I shouldn't be generalizing about genders like that, my bad. Just FYI, my fiance is under 6 feet tall (we're the same height when I wear heels) and I have no problem with it.  I, of course, have things I'm attracted to in men's appearance. Don't ask why, but I really like guys' hair and hairstyles (not talking about man buns though lol). However, I know that most men experience male pattern baldness and it often starts in their 30s. If my fiance starts developing a bald spot, I'd still love him.",relationship_advice
973,e68yci,Buttercupsdaily,1575506247.0,2,A break,"I need advice on this please help. I am going to try to be as clear as possible.

Background: My boyfriend and I met 3 years ago. When we worked together. After a 6 months of dating he left our job to start his dream job (super proud of him). I followed suit and went to school to for my dream profession. As I went to school I worked night shift at the job we worked at together to help with our rent. We move in together after 2 years. We were a dream team supportive, kind, open, affectionate, we compromise when needed. 

Problems that came up in order:
1- this one was a big one for me: he told me after a year that he was a fan of smoking pot. At this time in my life I was not okay with that as a habit of my spouse. How I resolved that: I tried it and accepted it as a social thing not everyday thing

2- 2 years in he smoked Friday morning - sunday night and sometimes during his work week. Sometimes he lied to me about it. Which we fought about on and off because I felt my opinion wasn't valued

3-  2.5 years in  I am in school full time and working nights full time. I guess I became impatient and high tempered. But he was super supportive making lunches for me and watching my kitty

4- A 3 years 2 months when I finished my program he told me that he found me irritable, angry, hard to talk to and annoying ( which I started seeing a therapist for depression shortly after). That he felt like while I was at school I made him feel guilty about going out during the week (well I was sleeping) I will add yes a few times I asked him to stay with me until I fell asleep because I missed him. After that we began to fight over everything. 

5- 3 years and 3 months I told him that I felt as if I was invisible, I told him I didn't feel like he cared about me. As time went on I realized that I wasn't just feeling it for the past 6 months he would always avoid me by being on his phone or video games which he made clear early on that I was not to interrupt him as it is rude. He would ask me about my day and pick up his phone right as I answered.... and we fought more. It got to the point where we couldn't be in the same room without doing little things to piss the other off ( our time had been spent together intoxicated and playing video games for the past 9 months only for the last 2 months of our relationship I stopped because I was experiencing too much anxiety with it, as I didn't feel like a good enough girl for him while intoxicated)

There was other things on the table I am sure that accounted for our behavior. I am sure I wasn't the nicest. He told me I can't keep bringing my bad days home (days when people yelled at me). I wanted a new kitten and he said no it's not a good time. I wanted to save for a house with him and he ignored that. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with PCOS which hit me pretty hard. He is very private. Where I like to discuss with my sibling to make sure I'm not over reacting which he didn't love. So for a long time I kept to my self. After I started night shift the amount of affection we gave eachother decreased pretty quickly and it never really returned after I finished school. 

The inevitable
We threatened eachother with breaking up multiple times. One night after a fight. We laid in bed and I asked him if I could ask him 3 questions and if he'd answer truthfully he agreed
1 Do you want to have kids with me? ""No I don't think we would last""
2 Are you head over heels in love with me? ""I remember what that feels like. No but I love you""
3 If we got married would we last? "" I don't think so because we can't communicate""
Our answered matched. I asked for space, time to think if he is right for me. He agreed and moved out.

It's almost been 2 months 
I ask myself everyday
Who am I?
Is he who I want?
Why do I think that? 
Am I okay with the idea of losing my bestfriend? 

I want to be alone. I don't want to date right now

But I feel pure guilt every single day.
I can't decide whether I should walk away or try again. I am not getting any younger and I don't want to waste years on a man who doesn't listen to me or value my opinion. I don't want a pot head. I know he quit smoking this month but I know his past habits. Am I being unfair? He says he wants me back that he will be more affectionate and listen to me. But just last week he asked me how I was and checked his phone while I answered. I got mad and dismissed him..... I know change doesn't happen over night but that tells me he doesn't respect how I feel still. 

And if I don't want to continue should I move out of our appartment. 

So being someone with no emotion in this what is your opinion?  Should I walk away or try to fix this relationship?",relationship_advice
974,e68y63,BigBarryBobBin,1575506225.0,0,My girlfriend is awkward about sex,"Me and my girlfriend have a child and she's hinting to be engaged soon.

I have some doubts about whether that's a good decision due to how strange sex can be sometimes. If I ask her for sex she gets frustrated that I'm nagging her but I have no idea when she wants sex because she insinuates that she wants it in the most mild ways. The other day I said to her ""damn we haven't had sex at all this week and I told you I needed it 5 days ago"" said politely in passing and not in a confrontational way. Then she said ""oh I wanted it last night when I came and gave you a cuddle, but you turned me down because you were on your laptop""

That's definitely not how I see it. Last night she came over and sat on the bed, she asked for a cuddle and said ""I'm really tired tonight"". I responded by asking her about soemthing I was working on.

This happens a lot. Where her signaling for sex is unreadable. I've told her about it and she is stubborn and says I should have known she wanted it because it was obvious.

I really don't know what to do, I feel resentment because I don't like coming onto her because of how shit it makes me feel to get rejected 3-4 days in a row.

It's also really unbalanced, she straight up asked me for sex while I was poorly a few weeks ago and I said I can't I'm too I'll and then she nagged and nagged till I gave in. I gave in and then when I needed it she said she didn't want to because she was too tired. I don't get why it's like this, with any of my previous partners its been pretty obvious when they want sex and having sex to 'sort one of you out' even if the other isn't up for it, was a normal thing. With this girlfriend it's just weird. 

Also she hasn't been on top during sex for 2 years which feels unfair.",relationship_advice

Is this Normal behavior? He’s 19, I’m 20. Just makes me feel pretty sick and uncomfortable. I asked him if he was unhappy w me and such and he claims he’s not and he “feels bad, it’s just what his dick is into” and I shouldn’t feel insecure and I’m still enough. I’m not sure. Please help.

977,e68xju,WolvesNGames,1575506150.0,1,Is my (20) boyfriend (19) clingy or am I too short tempered?,"TLDR: Boyfriend called me twice when I was out to buy some things/look around for christmas gift ideas because he wanted to talk to me but had no topic. We spend hours talking through Discord when we're at home (not living together). I don't like speaking on the phone in public, especially not when my headphones (bluetooth) aren't connected/ disconnect during the call. This is not the first time he's done this and he knows I don't like it.

Hope this isn't too long

We usually spend A LOT of time together via Discord (basically all the time both of us are home and doing things around the computer, which is almost always). We don't necessarily do something together, sometimes we watch the same video/play online games together/discuss topics but if not we're just silently doing our own stuff. 
We do see each other sometimes but I don't usually like seeing him physically unless I want thing to get hot because if I'm not in the mood it's either just boring (watching videos to pass time, which I don't find any different than what we do while online), annoying (him trying to convince me to have sex when I'm not in the mood at all/ I'm too stressed about the location) or rushed and distant (spending time together going from x to y).
In the begining of the relationship I had to convince him that it wasn't ok to come to my house at any hour just because I got mad and felt the need to retreat (aka disconnect from Discord or any other device/app that people could contact me through) because I couldn't handle my anger and continuing the argument we were having would only make it worse.
Nowadays whenever I'm somewhere else (university /around the city)  ,when he is home and bored, he messages me,asking where I'm at and when I'm coming home. Sometimes, if he is sure/almost sure I'm not in a course at university he calls because he wants to talk to me with no particular subject to discuss about.
It is annoying to be called without a reason, stoping the video I was listening to (music, reddit stories, informational videos, etc) or the conversation I was having with someone in real life, to be met by silence after exchanging formalities (""hi, what are you doing?"" ""Coming home/ grabbing some x, how about u?"" ""I'm fine, when are you getting home"" ""Idk, do you need something from me?"" ""Nah, just wanted to talk"" *few seconds later after I get tired of waiting for a sound and frustrated that I switched what I was listening to for silence and that my hand is freezing/getting tired from holding the phone with thick clothing* ""So... do you want to talk about something or can I hang up?"" ""I wanted to talk with you.."" ""About.....?"" ""Nothing in particular, I just wanted to talk to you"" ""Then give me something to talk about"" ""I don't know..."" ""Then can I hang up?"" ""You never want to talk to me when I call you"").
 It just feels like he is way too clingy especially considering how much time we already spend talking with each other. Also this doesn't occur as often when is already talking with the friends we play video games with.
I think this annoys me because I'm enjoying that time apart from him as a time to be alone with my thoughts, enjoy whatever is happening on my own terms, at my own speed and getting calls/ spam messages is breaking that. I'm not 100% sure this is the reason though.",relationship_advice
978,e68vs4,aspringtimefallacy,1575505935.0,1,"I'm stuck in a deep rut with having no life, and I don't know how to develop one and make friends. It's not impossible, but I have no idea what to do.","I'm off school for two weeks yet again, and I have no one to talk to, no reason to go outside, and I'm not learning anything.

 I have no motivation because I'm extremely anxious, don't know what to say or when or even where and have never successfully befriended a stranger or even got past one conversation, (I dont even know how to small talk right), and I feel really stupid about it, because I don't even know how to find out how to do these things in the first place.

My 16 year old life revolves around occasionally reading books, about twelve hours of gaming interspersed with movies and TV. Its like I'm on life support, like I'm stuck, stagnating, and as much as I really want to do something about it, I dont know how, and that's the point I really need help with.

My therapist doesn't inform me of these things or teach me to socialise, instead saying I know how to do these things (r/wowthanksimcured) and all i need to do is become more confident. She paraphrases it and leads it around to that a lot, and I never realise until after each session, and im beginning to feel worse and worse, so I have no idea if therapy is working for me. I'd hate to say anything of this to her though, she's only doing her job.

I don't want to become self-pitying, nor do I want to be a no-life shut in with nothing but migraines, boredom and anxiety to keep me company.

It's definitely possible, socialising is a human concept after all, and as much as Aspergers may seem like it can make it harder, I've heard of people who are able to make friends with Aspergers, after doing things and taking steps to develop their social skills. I don't know how to do those things, but I want out of this rut, it just doesn't feel healthy.

I've been doing my best to be there and support him but he's been in such a bad mood for weeks now and it's really starting to affect me.

I've been under a lot of stress recently with 2 jobs, 2 uni courses and an internship and it's really hard to keep on top of everything and still be a good partner. 

I know I have codependent tendencies, I try to satisfy his emotional needs at the detriment of mine, so WIBTA if I brought up that I wanted some time apart to focus on my own mental health for a little bit?

At first I was ecstatic to be his girlfriend but as time went on I'm starting to feel conflicted. 

He keeps trying to take things faster than things I would like it, he keeps trying to engage into sexual talk, ect, and I have told him this multiple times that I dislike it (I'm not the one for sexual desires) but he doesn't listen. Often he'll say that I'm his first priority, that I brought him out of depression and that he'll do anything for me, when I have a problem or that I just need to vent and he will more often than not just leave me on read, and he'll often ignore me claiming that he's ""busy"" when it shows that he's online still talking.

I'm starting to dread talking to him, seeing his name pop up in my notifications makes me feel sick, but I still somehow convince myself that I still love him.

So my gf and I have been dating since spring of last year, broke up over the summer for complicated but resolved reasons and are now together since September. 

We both go to the same university and see each other everyday. We do not argue about anything except one topic that always comes up; time spent with each other. I am the type of guy to think it’s important to see each other a good amount each week. Preferably every day but I understand when one is busy and can’t hang out for a day. I’m reasonable and not controlling. My gf is not as fixated on the idea of seeing each other everyday although she tries her best to make me happy. We usually argue about me wanting to see her and her having reasons for not being able to hang out. We always compromise and I try my best to be understanding. Anyways, our almost month long winter break is coming up. We only live an hour and 20 minutes from each other yet she has said she won’t see me citing wanting to be with her family. She is heavily attached with her family. The problem is that as a couple we struggle with being apart and usually end up arguing more and not communicating as well. I said that I only expect to see her a couple of times and she can see her family for the entirety of the rest of break yet she still won’t agree to see me. I don’t know what the difficulty is and am just hoping for some other opinions on this.

My boyfriend came over in a bad mood and he was acting like an asshole and I was not very nice about it. Normally I’d comfort him but he was just rude, not even sad or anything. I knew he was mad but I just came home from my job and I wasn’t in the best mood either, I’m tired and stressed a lot of the time. Idk we started to argue and he started to hit me. It wasn’t super hard or anything and I don’t have marks like no scratches or bruises nothing like that, but he slapped me and it hurt a little but I’m fine now. I was really upset afterwards because it’s just disrespectful and I hate it and he’s not like that, like I don’t understand why he’d do that to me. And then he started crying and apologized and he told me that he failed one of his exams so he’s kicked out of his program since he was already on probation and that’s why he was upset and hit me. He was basically projecting onto me. Which hurts a lot since I didn’t do anything. And if he told me I would have comforted him and tried to help him find something else to apply into or help him ask the department for a second chance. I don’t even know what to do. I told him that it really hurts that he put his hands on me and he apologized a lot and said he feels stupid because he thought I’d be mad or disappointed or think he’s stupid if he told me he was kicked out. Idk. I asked him if we could maybe take a break and just like figure things out first and he started crying a lot and said he ruined his academic career and sabotaged our relationship now and he was just really upset. Honestly he doesn’t usually get emotional like that, I rarely see him cry so I told him I’ll stay because I was worried about him. Idk I just wished he used his words and told me what was wrong instead of like. Slapping me. Idk what to do. I just feel disrespected and humiliated. Getting hit is like being treated like a kid.

He is a virgin, and I am not the experience in person but I had a couple of boyfriends. We talked about it, we made it clear that we both wish to have sex.
