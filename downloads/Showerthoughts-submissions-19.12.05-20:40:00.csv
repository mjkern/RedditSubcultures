420,e6msg4,luujs,1575576604.0,1,We are not in control of our actions or our thoughts,"We like to believe we are, but we act based on how others treat us, who in turn act based on how others treat them. If one baby was cloned with exactly the DNA, and then the two clones were sent to two different families in two different counties, then they would turn out completely different. This is because they would be raised according to different parents’ values, and grow up and be influenced by different people. Resulting in the genetically identical people potentially having vastly different beliefs. Of course, their basic instincts would be the same at the very start, but they would be molded into completely different people based on their location and their lives. Their responses to the same issues would therefore become unrecognisable from one another as one might have overcome a fear that the other one hasn’t. 

Human thought is also completely influenced by external sources. Your thoughts are based entirely about how you were raised and what has happened in your life, you directly affect nothing about your thought process. You think in a certain way based on the actions of others, you act in a certain way based on the actions of others. You might behave differently from other people, however you still react to external influences that make you act the way you do. You are the way you are, completely because of external influences. You have certain reactions to certain events because of your life experiences such as the way you were raised. Your parents raised you in that way based on their life experiences, and their parents did the same to them.",Showerthoughts
