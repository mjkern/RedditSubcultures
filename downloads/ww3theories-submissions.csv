1,dbo5by,valoros0702,1569904603.0,6,WW3 theory,"After years of passive aggressiveness, North Korea has a small missile launched at South Korea, another Korean War starts, with tension between the US and North Korea already high, the US decide to get involved. After a raid of North Korea which put a severe dampen on their military, China is pissed. China declares war on the US. The protesters in Hong Kong start rioting, China, dealing with the protesters, is distracted. The US surrounds the west and south border with ground troops and navy. Russia threatens the US with war if They Don’t Retreat. Britain, trying to remain neutral stays out of the matter, but has pressure put on them from both sides, they take a defensive standpoint. Then it happens... The US takes drastic measures and drops a nuclear warhead on Hong Kong. Russia immediately declares war on the US, feeling confident in their nuclear arsenal. The two sides take turns sending nukes at each other, the White House, the pentagon, an the Capitol were all levelled due to this exchange, Russia had an economic collapse, and other countries with no involvement quickly took a side. With this, nuclear warfare took place, in the end it died down because the countries had almost nothing. almost nothing of value was left in the countries involved, besides Britain who had taken a defensive position near the beginning of the war. With 3 massive countries being destroyed, the world had an economic collapse, rioting took place, and the world was in anarchy. The war may have been over, but it permanently scarred humanity",WW3Theories

3,crmg42,Notch_4682,1566050223.0,3,Maybe a theory,"So, we attack Iran. Under the political pressure, America declares war on Russia and sends waves of cyber attacks. The EU turns into a superstate, but the UK leaves, effectively tearing the country apart. Old enemies go to war, like India and Pakistan, Israel and the Arab League, and China and Taiwan.

And Switzerland remains neutral, unless the Eu tries invading it.",WW3Theories

If you look at the biggest economies of the worlda its US, China,  Japan, Germany. Russian is not even in the top 10 so they cannot really sustain war, even though they have a decent military. What they can do is keep America spread out in multiple conflicts like middles East, eastern Europe and even a touch in South America. 

China economy has been gaining traction in the last few years and they been increasing military presence in the Pacific making the US keeping a close watch and keeping presence in this area as well.

Basically being a super power mean you are going to be present in many parts of the world and that has a big overhead cost. All of them are just playing chess, so that the US spreads thin and has high overhead costs.

There is a curve ball... AI...
Artificial intelligence has the potential to completely flip the economy upside down. It also has the potential to make some crazy military things, it can be used in pretty much anything...

It's basically a big race to who can reach this future like state of AI, where robots perform labor jobs, all services are automated, taxies, deliveries... super computers enhance with AI for research and so forth etc etc... Whoever reach this singular point will probably be the world's super power because you can start making huge progress in no time.

On the other hand, if no clear winner. Ideologies and values from country to country will most likely cause clash which could turn into a war 

So unless there is a huge economic crash or AI singularity to catalyst a world war. I think they will just keep playing chess games to see who will survive the longuest.

Cheers,

I don't have any set date, which country will attack first but I heard this before... It's always the weakest opponent that strikes first as they need to element of surprise on there side.",WW3Theories
6,cki94t,Notch_4682,1564626451.0,3,Your guide to r/WW3THEORIES,"A good theory should be thinking about current tensions in the world and tying it all together to make a war plan.

Politics are essential, as well as history, unions, and the UN.

Army comparisons and political thinking influence invasion plans, so make sure to take that into account.

Also, follow the rules and reddiquette, and start preparing your plans!",WW3Theories
