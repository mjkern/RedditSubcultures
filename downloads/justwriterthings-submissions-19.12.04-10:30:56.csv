# The Crumpled Knife

## A Short Storyby TheDryduck

Richard Superhalk looked at the crumpled knife in his hands and felt fuzzy.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his damp surroundings. He had always hated deprived Upper Boggington with its kindly, klutzy kettles. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel fuzzy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather some*one*. It was the figure of Bob Thunder. Bob was an incredible gamer with moist eyebrows and fluffy spots.

Richard gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a giving, snooty, squash drinker with wide eyebrows and vast spots. His friends saw him as a lively, lonely lawyer. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a graceful old lady.

But not even a giving person who had once made a cup of tea for a graceful old lady, was prepared for what Bob had in store today.

The drizzle rained like cooking aardvarks, making Richard unstable.

As Richard stepped outside and Bob came closer, he could see the small glint in his eye.

""I am here because I want some more Facebook friends,"" Bob bellowed, in a callous tone. He slammed his fist against Richard's chest, with the force of 278 horses. ""I frigging hate you, Richard Superhalk.""

Richard looked back, even more unstable and still fingering the crumpled knife. ""Bob, let's move in together,"" he replied.

They looked at each other with sneezy feelings, like two angry, afraid aardvarks drinking at a very giving wedding, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two deranged uncles loving to the beat.

Richard studied Bob's moist eyebrows and fluffy spots. Eventually, he took a deep breath. ""I'm sorry, but I can't give you some more Facebook friends,"" he explained, in pitying tones.

Bob looked barmy, his body raw like a grim, graceful guillotine.

Richard could actually hear Bob's body shatter into 2137 pieces. Then the incredible gamer hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Richard's nerves tonight.

87,d26b7b,Jax4519,1568115460.0,6,My English essay,So there were these people called Nazis and they hated jewish people. They thought that everyone should value that idea. They did this thing with concentration camps and these things wouldn’t actually help people focus it was actually used to kill people which is like so screwed up like if you are going to kill people in a camp call them killing camps not concentration camps people might get confused and try to get in to study. So back to my book there's this really cool lady whos husband owns a zoo but it's a lot sadder than we bought a zoo there were no nazis in that book and movie so like they have this zoo and the nazis come and are like “we want to hunt you’re animals” and the zoo people were like “no we like our animals” and the nazis were like” too bad so sad we like shooting things and these animals look like animals” then they probably had an epic ninja fight i'm not sure i got bored but then like there were these people who stayed at the zoo and they ran out of food and there was a really sad part where they couldn’t feed them and toothless had to go home which was really sad because he was my favorite dragon in how to train you’re dragon and he and hiccup deserve to be friends for ever and then the nazis didn't like anybody except other nazis and so they sometimes did like blonde people but like they were still mean and like i'm not blonde so they wouldn’t like me so i don't like them as jesus once said say no to hitler and jesus knows best because he believes in santa and santa hates hitler hitler hated hitler because hitler killed hitler who killed the guy who killed the hitler. Guy fieri doesn't think hitler is cool because hitler didn't give good food to people which is so selfish if you want the bag of doritos just tell me and ill buy my own!!! I just think people should be nice if abraham lincoln we're still here hitler would be so scared because lincoln would?

Okay. This was supposed to be some sort of mystery for the characters to solve. Now I hadn't thought this through, I don't know who burned it down nor who sent the letter informing them. Now **I** have to solve the mystery so I can write it. **I have to solve my own made-up mystery.**  

So I was going on looking at all my characters like suspects and assessing their motives 🕵️‍♀️🤦‍♀️ I'm also creating new characters who might possibly have the motive to do that to spice things up as well (this is helping with world-building honestly, who knew? 😵)

Anyone else gone through something like this?
