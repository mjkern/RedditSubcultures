As you may have seen, there was an elaborate discussion on the Horses & Video Games Discord server on the subject. To summarize: 

* 36 miles per day is not unrealistic, but would be on the higher end of most estimates  
* most sources I can find (links can be found on the discord) put their estimate for daily horse travel distance at around 30 miles  
* Modern endurance racers (and extreme cases in the past, possibly?) may manage up to 40 or 50 miles in a day, but a horse would probably need care and rest after, rather than travelling another day.   
* for the old west setting, you would probably be looking at breeds like Quarter Horses or Mustang mixes: relatively short, stocky horses (rather than very light, very tall or draft horse types). (feel free to ask for photo references! simply googling quarter horses tends to result in finding modern, overmuscled halter horse types)  
* Equipment, supplies carried, rider weight and terrain may factor into the result",2019-10-12 11:13:36

Since my personal pet pitch is ""Stardew Valley, but with horses"", I'd super be here for a 2D pixel art stable sim, for example. The reason why I'm making my own game in 3D is because I'm better at 3D-modelling than 2D art, not because I think the project would have to be inherently 3D. (And the gameplay is 2D, for the most part)

Generally, I think many genres of horse games would work perfectly fine in 2D. Perhaps not a realistic riding simulation, but stable management, horse companion adventure, any ""horse girl"" type of story... There are far, far more important aspects to scope and quality than the 2D/3D question.",2019-05-20 08:07:23
