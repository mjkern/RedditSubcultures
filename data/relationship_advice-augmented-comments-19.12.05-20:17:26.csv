that may be the single most selfish thing I’ve ever seen on the sub. He’s had a lifelong decision made for longer than he’s known yet. You are not his wife you’re not the mother of his child, you are somebody that he wants to have fun with before he leaves for the military. There’s a reason that relationships with active duty individuals feel so commonly. Your selfishness will ruin the relationship before that.

I feel like you're rushing into the relationship and this should give you a clue to ""slow down"". You guys have been together for a year and you've built a life together that's fine. HOWEVER he just showed you that he self sabotages pretty hard there. It is good that he came forward but it shows you something you need to consider going forward. For one your trust for him is going to get lowered, even if he told you. He needs counseling by himself. If your sex life is isn't good after a year something is seriously wrong and it is good that you chose to go to couples counseling but in honesty I think you know he has a lot of baggage he needs to deal with. Couples counseling might help but realistically he just needs a therapist.  

I think you're just too head over heels to see things clearly, however I think the relationship can still work. This is not something that can easily be solved in one year or two years. This takes years to deal with. Yes I'm talking about his issues not your relationship per say.

28,f9siz1s,e6qn0g,Traeyze,1575593378.0,1,"A needs to get very real about this situation. The reality is that B clearly only has romantic intentions with him and the fact that she is willing to use a \[fake\] suicide attempt to get his attention shows she has mental health issues as well. As it stands he is now sending both of you mixed messages.

So by continuing to be so close with her he really risks leading her on. She approached him romantically and he rejected her, that changes the dynamic and it is hard to go back from that. She is actively sabotaging your dynamic with him, so that shows that really those two can't be friends as they are now. 

It also shows that he more or less condones what she is saying and doing and that really only sends the message that he cares less about your feelings than hers. Maybe its because he convinces himself that she needs help, but he chose a relationship with you \[and he isn't a therapist\] so he needs to decide what that actually means... and so do you.

So you can't control who he sees, but it is also true that if he continues to see her he is choosing to hurt the both of you. And that is what I mean by him getting real. In the end this path just ends in everyone being hurt.",2019-12-06 00:49:38

I cant blame you for what you are feeling and dont feel bad either for feeling this way. Continue to work in therapy and process these feelings so that you can overcome them. Just please dont beat yourself up for feeling this way. It sounds to me like you are aware of the possibility that this is affecting you and you are interpreting because of your own trauma.

Being in a relationship is a lot of hard work and hard enough for just two people. When you start inviting others opinions, it complicates things. Her friend may mean well but from her perspective, because of her own triggers/experience she may think that you are controlling. Its likely that you girlfriend simply shared with her how you dont like short hair and out of respect for you did not go into detail as to why. 

If your girlfriends friend knows why you feel that way and is ""purposely"" saying that to get a rise out of you, then she may be a toxic friend in my opinion.",2019-12-06 00:23:46
73,f9sht1m,e6q8dv,Traeyze,1575592684.0,1,"So it seems a lot of this comes back to the trauma you received while dating that other girl. So what steps have you take to unpacking that and dealing with it? Are you seeing a therapist regarding your bipolar? And if you are, have you ever discussed the trauma? Because while there will definitely be aspects of your general moods [depression and manic phases] it is common that a lot of sufferers also have deep anxiety issues as a result of trauma, often just from dealing with the Bipolar and it's fallout itself. If you haven't discussed it with the therapist you really should. 

Raising it is tricky because in a lot of ways I don't think you are entirely clear on what it is you want to say and the concern is you might just confuse her. So for the moment you need to focus on actually deciding what you feel about all this. That is why it is important to work out how the trauma of that ex impacts you and how much of that informs how you feel now.",2019-12-06 00:38:04

She had issues, angry ones, abusive ones, controlling ones, and she finally got them under control after years and years of me taking the abuse, standing by her side and only a little after we got married I realized it was to late. It drained me of my life, my energy, my patience and my love. I don't know if that's exactly what you are going through, but all I can tell you for sure is that when you walk out of that house you will find new life, new energy and a new sense of self. 

I also know that although she may be stable now, when you finally leave her, when you finally sit down and calmly say ""this is it, I'm done, I can't do this"" she might revert back to her old ways, my ex wife did, and it made it really hard to stay calm. It went on for days, texting, emails, calls but I stayed confident in my decision I knew I had to. For my own mental health.

I wish you luck man...I really do. Be confident, resolved in your decision and always remain respectful. Have an exit plan, where are you going and for how long. Will she come after you financially since you were common law (not sure the rules of where ever you are)? Sometimes commonlaw is almost equivalent to being married, so if you think there is alot of money at stake you may want to talk to a lawyer first. 

I also know that we had ups and downs, and so sometimes she was great, and then sometimes she was bad and it came and went. So what I'm wondering is if she seems good right now, it may not be permanent... something to keep in mind.

Anyway, as I said, good luck. I think life is about finding happiness, which is not a destination but a mind set, so if your with someone who can't let you have that mindset because of the past, you gotta move on!",2019-12-06 00:08:16

Here's the thing, you gotta talk about it. Otherwise you'll get nowhere. If she's not realizing it then she's gotta become aware of it.

Physical attraction is often looked down upon in relationships because ""you're supposed to love someone for who they are and not their looks"" or some bullshit. 70 lbs is no trip in the park, that's damn near 100 lbs. 

The thing about it is handling it with tact and respect for your partner. Maybe talk to her friends or mutual friends, express your concerns to them (respectfully of course) it's a possibility she had body image issues growing up and being with someone she cares about let her relax the idea of being healthy in the place of comfort. Then of course the most important part, communicate with her your feelings.

He’ll realize some enough that being in a relationship where not everyone is invested is a waste of emotional resources. I would definitely do this in person and remember you’re making the best decision for yourself, and that it’s perfectly fine to do what’s in your best interest. It’s also helpful if you sit down ahead of time and write down your feelings and reasons, it makes it easier to articulate them in person.

Best way? Honest, calm and compassionate. You don’t need to go into lots of detail like the above if you don’t want to. Just explain you don’t have those feelings for him anymore and feel you’d prefer to be single right now.

There are never any guarantees a break up will be smooth as there is no accounting for their reaction, but all you can do is be kind, but firm. Don’t waver or agree to ‘one last try’ if your mind is set. A public place is helpful if you think he might react badly. Plus it’s more neutral for you both and you can leave when you choose.

I genuinely think this is what's going on - your bf cares and is absolute shit at showing it.

 If you're honest about it and tell him you believe this is important and how this makes you feel  (be specific with men just tell him what you want from him point blank), I don't think it's much of a sacrifice for him to stay in with you twice or 3 times a year on your birthday and during your fever. 

""I know you can't relate and I don't expect you to make a big deal about every birthday now or to exaggerate every illness, but I just want you to stay home/do something extra on those occasions just because you know I make a big deal out of those things and I need/want you there.""

Maybe don't expect words and constant checking in, but if he stays with you and just shows by his actions that he remembers this is important to you it's a win.

As for how you go about it, I suppose it depends on the kind of dating you want to do. A lot of people talk about asking a girl out and getting to know them and that is not something I have ever done.

We talked about it several times and tried to figure out ways to put us on the same level, but nothing really worked. He often wanted to have sex several times a day, and I couldn't match that. I stayed for almost 5 years, and we were both suffering throughout that time.


Have you two discussed how often both of you would like to have sex? Also, have you talked about why her sex drive has decreased? It might help to know each of your expectations and motivations for being intimate with each other. Having a meaningful and kind conversation about it to figure out what, if anything, can be done to make both of you feel appreciated, wanted, and sexually satisified could help you decide whether you are sexually compatible anymore. If one of you decides that nothing can be done, it might be time to move on. Sex is really important in a relationship, and making yourself stay in a relationship in which you are incompatible could cause a lot of hurt for both parties. There's no sense in hanging onto the relationship if it can't improve and if neither of you are happy. You'll both save yourselves a lot of resentment, pain, and sadness if you accept that. 


If you two decide to work on it as a couple, though, make sure you're putting in the effort. Find ways to discuss whether the effort you are both putting in is making a difference, and how you each feel about how the relationship is going. You might also want to check out some information on love languages. It might help you figure out how to direct your efforts.",2019-12-05 23:04:44

But you need to change your thought process it won’t happen over night but it will happen, and before you go thinking “no it won’t work” This woman managed to change and manipulate your thought process so you can do it with your own brain! I’ve got an exercise you can do but you have to be completely honest in it and no making excuses for her, this list is about you and how you feel ok?

Now write down everything you liked about her and the relationship... btw I get you two had great sex but don’t include this if after the sex you felt shitty about the situation or if she had a tendency to use sex as an apology or get what she wants.  You need to look for the genuinely good parts about her and be completely honest, the parts where you’ve mentioned her being nice with an insult obviously does not count in this category!

Now Write down everything she did wrong including the little things  and be brutally honest about it, write down everything you disliked. Every time she made you feel shitty even if you feel she didn’t mean it (she did btw).  If something made you feel negatively write it down!!!!!!


Now when you’ve done this and have been completely honest your list of negatives will be extremely long and you may have begun ranting but that’s ok and is good!! Now I want you to read through the negative list a few times adding to it if you have to... now go back to the positive list if anything in that list is part of something that happens in the negative list for example: upsetting you and being nasty and then apologising, being all over you and giving you amazing sex, this isn’t a positive, this is manipulation so you need to move it to the negative. So make sure you study that positive list and look into each bullet point.  You’ll more than likely move more than half to the negative list!! 

Now when you know you’ve been 100% truthful in these lists look at them and compare them.

Now imagine you had a friend come to you and tell you about this “amazing” woman who had these (or lack of) great qualities and named everything in the positive and negative lists etc. What would your advice be to him? How would you make him see that she’s no good?

Write a letter to yourself from the perspective you were writing it to a friend and just write all the reasons why this woman is no good etc.

You're describing a GF who apparently has a very strong abandonment fear. Such a fear would explain why, at a time when you need her emotional support, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- and started showing she is incapable of trusting you. 

If this is the case, you likely will soon see her trying to isolate you away from your close friends and family members. She would view your spending time with your friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER.
This strong abandonment fear -- as well as her abusive and controlling behaviors -- may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 3 other warning signs you have not mentioned.

First, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

Second, you would not see her expressing her anger to total strangers (e.g., road rage against strangers). Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).

Third, you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between Jekyll (adoring you) and Hyde (devaluing or hating you) -- making you feel like you're often walking on eggshells. Such flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. Have you been seeing strong occurrences of these 3 red flags?",2019-12-05 22:34:13

You make yourself available to them. If they need to talk, you're there to listen. If they need food, you bring it. If they need help with chores, you lend a hand. You tell them you love them.

You dated for 2 years and had sex 3 times, never really giving her a sense of why you were so put off by it, doesn't it seem likely she might have taken that personally and presumed it was something to do with her? After all, most 20 year old guys can't seem to get enough sex, while she has a partner who seems to loathe it. You never let her know you were anxious so she could have taken it personally or just presumed you weren't as interested as you seemed.

So while sex is a factor, the reality is that it was also communication. You weren't clear about your feelings and by extension mislead her. That takes a toll on a relationship and that it was a sexual matter only compounded it. She was patient, it was a long relationship, but inevitably it pushed her away.

So no, I don't think it was about sex specifically, more about what it said about your dynamic. Limping back to her and saying you are horny isn't going to fix this, because at the end of the day the real issue is that you never dropped your guard and opened up to her.",2019-12-05 22:31:50

Like help with the kids more, or give you a massage at the end of the day.

For feelings I heard uncomfortable, confused, not upset, kinda turned on. 

Also there were a bunch of stories you were testing for what it may mean. 

My suggestion is that there are a lot of kinds of kisses in the world and many of them are not “trying to break up with my so/ trying to steal your partner” kinds. The quick peck and walk away is not the same as a deep make out session, in a lot of places it’s hello/goodbye. 

Your bf appearing uncomfortable/ guilty .. in a world where different people have different standards of monogamy it’s easy to get into a place where you think you may be over a line but not sure. 

Dan Savage has a lot of writing about “monogamish” which may help you to look up. 

There are plenty reasons why seeing your SO with someone else can be a turn on.  

How to start the conversation without knowing how you feel— own it. For example- 

“”So I saw x kiss you at that party, and I want to talk about it. First off, I’m not mad about it right now. I have a number of feelings that are confusing, but if this kiss *doesn’t* mean you want to breakup with me, then I’d like to talk more about what it does mean and then maybe  what is and isn’t considered cheating for you and me so we know what we are agreeing to””",2019-12-05 22:41:06

now for my rant: did you actually ask him whether he was up for something serious?

if YES: you're looking for different things. move on

if NO (RANT!!) then I guess he simply threw it at you for no reason. I (32F) am old and jaded enough to immediately cancel people when they just randomly announce they want nothing serious. it'd be an entirely different thing if it were contextualised, but if it is randomly stated, there is this implicit preconceived (by them) idea that you honestly need to stop fantasizing about them because they will not give into you regardless who you are. and the reason why I will no doubt cancel you if you warn me you don't want anything serious when not asked about it is... I don't do that. why? I don't find myself irresistible enough to randomly warn strangers not to fall for me. and while I know it's a gamble and not 100% of people warning me they are not up for serious stuff are actually warning me out of self importance, I will rule anyone who throws such statements at me out just to make sure I am not dealing with such degrees of self importance.

I myself am not looking for anything serious, but I honestly don't see the point in the warning. it's useful in case they fall for me? who am I, Elizabeth Taylor!? I speak fluent French, but I don't advertise it randomly. I graduated medical school, but mention it only when discussing occupations.

And it doesnt sound like you work (correct me if Im wrong) so it does sound like maybe an abrupt career change is impratical at the moment, so if this is absolutely going to happen, I think instead of being upset, you should use the time he is with you to prepare. You can start by getting your license & making sure you have everything you need to be independent ( you don’t want to HAVE to rely on family as a crutch, but theyre great for support) and then start adjusting to doing stuff with you and baby. Obviously spend quality time as a family, but also get out and run errands just you and baby and get a feel for it so you can just see what it’s like and in the beginning you can come home reflect and unwind with him. The more you do it, the more confident you’ll become, the less dependent you’ll feel, and the less drastic it will be when the change comes. And if the nervousness around doing this by yourself is adding to the PPD, it might help some. 

If this something you guys arguing about, it might help that, too. I’m sure he doesn’t want to leave you and new baby for so long, but it’ll go a long way for the both of you if he knows that you’ll be okay while he’s gone physically, and him and family are a phone call away if you need to vent.

Actually her presence just filled the lack of life you had in your relationship with your girlfriend. And that's ok, as long as you acknowledge it. I understand that your problem now is the fact that you still love her and in my opinion, you will always do. You think you've lost her and it might be the case, if you stop fighting for her. If she truly loves you, and I know what I'm saying having personally been through this, she will forgive you, even if she needs time to do this.

Whether or not this is the root of it, only your husband can say. Also, his occasional bringing this up indicates that this *is still* an issue for him that you two need to deal with. From the way you talk, you aren't really helping him through his insecurities because you feel that you haven't done anything wrong, and that this is entirely *his* problem to deal with, which I think is not healthy for either of you.

As a man, I would find this incredibly disturbing. From reading some of your replies it looks like any time you are personally attacked, you revert to ""I was 18 and dumb, so it was ok,"" which is whatever, I can get behind that. But keep in mind your husband was also dumb and young and might have thought that with enough time and growth he would be able to get over this - and for the most part I think he has, and I commend him for it.

So we 'joke'.  
  
You want to fix it? You could sit down with him and have a heart to heart. really just talk it all out. and maybe that works because your husband is a real progressive lad who wasn't raised to idolize the classical male values and doesn't internally judge his own self worth based on how closely he approximates those ideals in comparison to other nearby males. Sure he'll never have the passionate wild multiple simultaneous orgasm animal sex that you and BIL shared(in reality or in BILs report or just in his mind), never have what ever it is that BIL has that led you to toss him what hubby had to earn and work for, but maybe he can rest easy after you explain that he's still a good father/husband and just a generally nice guy despite all that inferiority.  
  
Or you could go the easy route and just play the male psyche. It's not hard, we're all just crafty monkeys, and we lose ~50iq points when romance/sex/jealousy are involved.  
Hint that the BIL sex was shit, you didn't orgasm, you weren't even attracted to him and it only happened because u were at a low point in your life / lonely after breakup/ sad about your dog/what ever. You didn't initiate or even really participate, just let it happen, passive observer. Anything BIL told him about the sex is just bluster to hide the fact that he never lasted more than 2min and struggled to get hard. BIL is shit in bed, and not that intelligent, and you would never even consider dating such a loser, let alone marrying him. He's also not aged well and kinda let himself go. You're honestly incredible embarrassed that you slept with someone so sad, and would appreciate if he didn't remind you of such a dark time in your life anymore. You're so happy/lucky to have found such an amazing sexy strong horse-dicked stoic manly man as hubby.  
  
Express some of that^ shit without any hint that you are trying to reassure him or address his insecurities and your problem will be solved. Stroke the fkn ego, make him feel superior to the perceived competition, and the insecurities will fuck off along with the shitty indirect method of communicating them. Its roundabout af, but you cant handle this shit directly with some guys.

854,f9rqpin,e6moii,Critical_Standard,1575579953.0,1,"So, i know that you are on the fence but really it sounds like you have one foot out the door.  


Like you I am 31 F and have been previously married, my ex husband and I rarely fought as well, though our marriage ended not because we both agreed on it, but because instead of working through issues, my ex husband found playmates outside of our relationship. What I'm trying to say is that just because a relationship doesn't fight, also doesn't mean it is healthy, just like every relationship that has it's struggles doesn't means it's bad.  


My husband and I have fought more than any of my previous relationships...but I also know my husband loves me fiercely. Not because he speaks my love language, but because we have taken the time to figure each other out...and we are still figuring each other out...relationships are hard.  


So my advice - nothing will work out if both parties don't want it to, and don't put the effort into it. In your way you've put effort in, in his way he has to, but because they are different ways it seems lost on the other. Same with how things hurt you and he keeps doing. People usually don't intend to hurt their SO's, that hurt is caused by people not understanding or putting the same importance on something. So the kid thing, to him it wasn't important because he doesn't think it's his, so why would he drag you into drama you don't need to be a part of? However on your side, this is an item that could potentially prove him wrong and then it does affect you, in a big way. BOTH points are valid though, they just aren't compatible because of importance, his is low on this item, yours is high.  


 If you want to try to make this work I highly recommend couples counseling, specifically Emotional Reattachment Counseling. It is what my husband and I have used in our relationship and it has helped us understand each other better. People aren't the way they are because they are a ""type of person"" who was magically birthed into the world this way. They are the way they are because of what they have been through, their family life, their past relationships, even the way they were received by their peers as a child...and it sounds like your relationship, if you continue with it, could really benefit from that.  


it's work though, and it's exhausting...and as a person who tends to adjust to my partners needs faster than my husband, there are times that I just want a break....but one thing that I am constantly reminded off in counseling both individually and as a couple, is that ultimately what we want is to be there for our SO's, we want to show up for them...sometimes we don't know how, and sometimes we are afraid of what it means if we try and fail...but a lack of action doesn't mean people aren't committed...it means something deeper is happening that they don't know how to or can't express...  


I wish you both the best of luck, no matter the direction you choose, it's a tough decision for sure.",2019-12-05 21:05:53

Ask him how he would feel if you were fapping to male pornstars. What if you started fantasizing about those male pornstars while being intimate with him? What if you started being more attracted to the male pornstar body than his?


If you just ask him how he would feel if you followed male pornstars he probably wont care, but if you ask him how he would handle the situations listed above then it starts to hit home that these behaviors can evolve to have really negative impacts.

Please, proceed with caution. Be gentle with your girlfriend. Don’t tell her to tell anyone anything. These are her experiences, and her emotions. You have no right to tell her what to do with them. 

As a young girl, I was abused by family. One of the family members is dead, may the devil keep his soul in flames for eternity. But the other is alive and well. I don’t talk to them much. I see them at family events, though never go out of my way to interact with them. It’s strange, and certainly fucked up.. but this is the dynamic. 

I never told anyone ever about the abuse, except my first boyfriend. When I told him, I felt kind of bad.. it was this demon I had been holding on to alone for so long and I just tossed it on to him to hold too. I felt guilty. He ended up being my rock, and my foundation. He listened to everything I had to say, never judged and let me decide what to feel. He softly encouraged counseling, and I did. Overall, the childhood trauma affected my love language, and our relationship in a large way until I faced it head on. The trauma stripped me of my confidence, and trust in men.. I am still working on it years later. But now the boyfriend I confided in, is now my husband. We’ve been together 7 years and have a son together.

The behaviors you describe -- i.e., verbal and physical abuse, threats of self harm, controlling demands, temper tantrums, black-white thinking, always being ""The Victim,"" and rapid flips between Jekyll (loving you) and Hyde (devaluing you) -- are classic warning signs for BPD.

Importantly, I'm not suggesting your exBF has full-blown BPD. Only a professional can determine that. Instead, I'm suggesting you consider whether he is exhibiting a strong pattern of BPD symptoms (i.e., is a ""pwBPD"").

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose his issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., returning to a toxic relationship or running into the arms of another man just like him. Learning the red flags also can help you decide whether professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/904mky/i_24m_am_currently_married_to_my_emotional_abuser/e2nploz/) to see if most sound very familiar.

You should absolutely spend Christmas with your family if that’s something you’ve been doing since you moved out of home, but you do need to take your gf into account. Maybe you could do one year on one year off. So go this year and tell your gf that next year it’ll be just the two of you, and then the year after you can be with your family.

It's helpful for me to realize why I feel this way. It's trauma, PTSD. It's like you were in a car accident (or a few) and now you have fear driving on the highway and of other cars. It's understandable why you would have these fears.

Best thing I can say is go to counseling. Find yourself a personal counselor and work on your fears. When you are in a new relationship see if they'd be willing to go to couples counseling. I highly recommend a couples counselor that works with the Gottman method, there are a few good books on the principals as well.

I’m actually in that exact spot right now (slightly different situation: I don’t know the girl from class, and there wasn’t ever a time when I talked with her EVERY day, just some days in which I developed some feelings for her). 

As for moving on, usually my best method is to distract myself. Basically, I’ll find some hobby of mine (preferably a healthy and active one) to really dive into and have fun with. Especially since I’ll be out of classes for a good few weeks coming up, I’ll have some free time to relax and enjoy myself alone or with my friends.

My wife cheated on me the first time we dated.  We were in high school, and both of us were fairly major teenage shitbags.  I didn't have a clue she was sleeping with someone else behind my back, and we broke up for unrelated reasons.  We bumped into each other years later out of the blue, and we decided to try again.  She told me right after we agreed to go back out because she wanted to start from a clean slate.

Even though I was six years removed from it, it still hurt like hell, especially with the added insult that she was not sleeping with me at the time.  It's always been a little bit of a nagging feeling in the back of my mind, especially when the guy in question came to her grandmother's funeral.  Granted, I knew he'd be there and thought I was prepped for it, but my wife says never before or since has she seen my hackles raised like that.  But I was willing to look past it; I acknowledge that I was something of a shithead myself and I laid the groundwork for it, and we were both young and stupid and needed some humility rudely beaten into us.

She has never once given me cause for concern or to think that she's even considered stepping out again, and if I'd simply bailed without giving her another chance, I'd have lost an incredibly kind, caring, selfless soul who puts up with my brand of bullshit like no other, and I would be lost without her.  She has always acknowledged that she majorly fucked up by stepping out on me, and to this day almost two decades removed from the actual cheating, if I were to throw the time she stepped out on me in her face, which I have (to my eternal shame) done during heated arguments, she'll immediately clam up and look at the floor.  Not once has she ever told me I need to get over it, or tried to shift the blame from her to me.

Because she still regrets it to this day, I don't think I'll ever have cause to worry.  It's why I don't like that Reddit has such a rigid view of cheaters.  Is it awful?  Is it terrible?  Yes, but sometimes it's not as black and white as just DTMFA.

Definitely try different positions. Some of them feel better for the receiver than others (doggy and cowgirl are 10/10). Also, slow, gentle, consistent stimulation of/circles on and around the clit is usually the most successful way to get most women.

Never be afraid to get toys! Any insecurities you may have about using them instead of just yourself will disappear when you see the response they can bring when used well. (That’s what my partner said after we found a good one.) Toys add a lot of spice and variety to the experience, and can also be used to enhance traditional sex if that’s what the two of you prefer.

I’d recommend vibrators, specifically the kind that have one part to go in the vagina and one to pay attention to the clit. They’re usually called rabbit vibrators. I’ve also heard cock ring vibrators can be really good to enhance sex.

Pro tip: $20 rabbit vibes on Amazon are actually pretty good, or you can find a YouTuber or someone else partnered with Adam and Eve (a sex shop with good stuff online) for a code to get 1/2 off one item.

Friend, the way you talk about yourself is so upsetting to me. Recognizing that you do have personal responsibility in your life is an important piece of the puzzle, but it seems like you have moved straight past responsibility and slammed into blame and fault. 

There's some things you need to take care of before anything can change. There's a difference between mental health and mental illness. Whether or not you have a diagnosable illness remains to be seen, but in any case, you are not mentally healthy right now. You can languish in that, or you can make a decision to make change. I can't give you the checklist on how to do that (everyone is different) but reaching out for professional help is a good start.

I want to say this, though: You're not a broken person. You have desires, wants, and needs. It is okay to ask your partner for support. If he can't handle it, that's his choice. But don't deprive yourself of intimacy by being afraid to ask for it. Asking is the only way.

After a lot of time wasting in the past two years, i went for legal guardianship, meaning myself and the mother and both equal guardians of our daughter, and have equal rights in saying what’s best for her etc 

Having that is like an anchor to back you up, as well as that, I physically go and get my daughter and take her back to where I live, and back again when our time together is up ( we usually spend every second weekend together) 

This way, her mom can’t make any excuses, it’s an organized time ( every second weekend), family can always know when they get to see her and a whole lot less unnecessary stress. 

If your girlfriend won’t bring her, then go get her. If it’s difficult or not an option in your position, tell your ex the issue, if she replies positively (helping find a solution, you will find one), if she replies negatively, then make it legal (go to a solicitor and tell her what’s going on). Again, the guardianship is great to have here again, cos you can say it’s your entitlement for your child to see his family. 

Also, grandparents usually have a right to legally enforce visitation for themselves if all else fails!

1413,f9r7iwx,e6kgvx,SugarBum33,1575572381.0,1,"SHE'S DATING HIS COUSIN JESUS CHRISTY

I'd say she's not even over him. I am embarrassed to admit this, but HECK, I had this guy whom I was IN LOVE with, and we had a sort of FWB thing going on but he was very clear that he didn't want a relationship with me. One day, he starts liking a girl and wanting to date her so naturally he says ""SugarBum, we must cease, we can still be friends but there will be no benefits"" and I was DEVASTATED. So I did the very normal and not phycho thing of DATING HIS ROOMMATE SO I COULD CONTINUE TO BE CLOSE TO HIM AND AROUND HIM AND STUFF. I'm maybe seeing a parallel of my situation to yours. Eek.

So on the one hand, nobody can put dibs on a person and he can like or not like anybody he wants. If you want to be together, then do it, and I'm happy for you that it's turned out so well and that you're having a good relationship. HAPPY. 

I am going to say though, on the tiniest other baby hand:

>I just knew it would hurt her

>My friend ofcourse made it a huge deal I told her I was torn between wanting to see where it goes with this guy, yet hurting her because I knew she liked him. but I told her that she knows me best and knows I would never purposely try to hurt her in any way

Weeeeeelllll you can't lie to yourself or her - you KNEW it would hurt her and you went for it anyways, which unfortunately means that you purposely hurt her - even though purposely hurting her wasn't the end goal, if that makes sense. You chose to go for the boy she liked knowing it would hurt her, and unfortunately:

>I never had a guy really Persue me and take so much interest in me he let me know how bad he felt about my friend and he even apologized to her and wanted to move forward. 

>she knows my heart and knows what I’ve been through I finally meet this guy

Says that you made it entirely about you, and less about how you were knowingly hurting a friend. 

So I'm going to mildly edit myself here. Maybe she's not over him. But I think it comes from a place of her not being over YOU and this situation. She feels betrayed. Putting in another life experience here - thankfully not as embarrassing - I have two friends who I love dearly. A very similar thing happened in which one (Jello) called dibs on a boy and the other (Tupac) only really found him to be friendly and OK. He pursued Tupac because he liked her better, Tupac was incredibly flattered by all the attention and pursuing, and so she tried to talk to Jello about it. Jello said ""I would really appreciate if you did not go for him as that would really hurt my feelings"" and Tupac still went for him. They didn't even date for very long but the damage had been done. It festered in Jello's heart and along with various other factors, Jello and Tupac ceased to be friends. They are on opposite ends of the country and in successful relationships, and Jello STILL TO THIS DAY (ALMOST TEN YEARS LATER) still reflects on that situation with hurt in her heart. 

You said at the end that you've talked several times - talked about what? Did you talk about this situation specifically? You don't have to apologize for dating a boy that you both liked, but I would say to ask her if you two can get coffee and talk about the issues that are weighing on your friendship. You could frame it as ""I am sorry that I  made you feel that your feelings weren't important to me"" ""You matter to me and I have seen from your actions - (this is where you talk about the specifics of what she's been doing - HOW does she try to humiliate you, HOW does she talk badly behind your back, etc. Don't be vague because she'll just deny it, that's how humans be) - that what happened really hurt you a lot. What can I do to fix things going forward?"" Give her a chance to talk, air out her feelings and really listen - take this time to make it about her, because as far as she's concerned, you made the original situation about yourself exclusively. She will probably tell you that she felt really betrayed and that you didn't care about her feelings and that you chose a boy over her, etc etc. Listen to what she has to say, if she tells you there's anything you can do then consider it if it's reasonable - like if she says ""Break up with Thing1"" well that's just not reasonable or realistic at this point. But you know, if it's something like ""I'd like to be able to talk about this more"" ""I would like to not be around him, or around you two together"" that's a little easier to make work. 

Don't question/confront her on the relationship with the cousin, don't involve the cousin, let that play itself out naturally. 

I don't know what else to tell you. Frankly, you cannot change the past at the end of the day, so maybe you did a hurtful thing back then, but she is the one being a bad friend now. This is a thing that happens - sometimes two friends like someone and that someone chooses one of the friends. It sucks, it's a shitty situation, but most people honestly move on from it. Most. You can try to fix things with her, or you can try to just live with it and let her tire herself out, or let it all come to head etc. That roommate I dated to get closer to that guy I liked? He dumped me because it had become very obvious that that was what I was doing. I still cringe about it to this day. When it gets to that point, the cousin will dump her too and life will go on. I dunno.

For your boyfriend - love him; be kind; give him the space to feel, remember, and be distracted at times. Being ""strong"" is not necessary. But taking care of yourself and your own grief is necessary. Be careful if you are the kind of person who naturally responds to trauma by pushing it away and taking care of other people. That's helpful for a day or two, but then you really need to face this yourself.

Grief is weird because it moves in two directions at the same time. You are moving forward with a big hole in your life, and you are trying to rearrange things to create a new life minus the person you love. At the same time you are fighting the sense that the person is disappearing. Yes, everybody is talking and remembering now - but in six moths or a year it can seem like the whole world has moved on and its like he never existed. Some people feel an even greater loss then, and need to talk and remind themselves and others that he was real and had made an impact that you still feel.

Expect emotions to be all over the map - sadness, anger, betrayal - a sense that future happiness has been taken away. It will come in bits and pieces and at unexpected times.

Now about her boyfriend. I don’t know what kind of a person he is. He pursued her 5 years ago as he had a bet with his friends that he’d woo the brightest girl in school. And he succeeded. 5 years ago. She was what, like 14. Hormones. Lol. So they were together for 2 years and he suddenly disappeared(went abroad to study i guess) without tellimg her for two years. sHE was brOKen. No seriously. But she kinda moved on. Then I came in. And ironically he suddenly appeared as well. Just my luck. And according to her, he’s a changed person; a better version of the old him. He’s still abroad and they only talk online. He told her he did it for her. And she truly believes it. I don’t know. Might be true. But to an outsider like me. It doesn’t seem like it. So whatever. I just want her to be happy. Even I felt I was the one for her. But she felt responsible for his “sacrifices” of going abroad for a better future for them. I could feel she’d lost her feelings him. And she couldn’t deny she didn’t have feelings for me when I asked. Anyway. She said firmly, that it’s her choice. And I couldn’t say a thing to that. So in the end, I suggested her that we stay friends. I am in love with her at this point. So I knew this was emotional suicide. She is so pure. I can’t stress this enough. She cried that she was doing this to me. But she couldn’t be unfair to him. I know. She is a dumbass too. Lol. So we were friends now. And just two days later, she said,” He isn’t liking it anymore. I can’t talk to you” and she left. I called her. Once. Her mom picked up. In my country, parents don’t accept romantic relationships that easily. And I didn’t want her to cause problems where she already was dealing with a lot. That’s the last time I called. I keep contact with a friend pf hers too. I ask stuff about her. Her friend is a nice person. She always tells me to forget her because she(her friend) strongly believes her boyfriend is a nice person because she(love interest) said so. Anyways. I don’t know if I am overdramatising it, but I feel like I know her the best. She is self-destructive, doesn’t say no easily. Is not smart when it comes to societal affairs. And will rather get hurt herself than hurt others. I fear for her. She is so pure and so positive about the world. I fear she’ll get hurt if she doesn’t learn and will become “dark” like teens do at their puberty when she is a varsity student. Which imo isn’t the best thing to happen. I thought I could be there for her. She always told me I was there for her. But now I cannot be. And I don’t need to be with her as much as I want to. I just want her to be smart when the time comes. So I guess my problem is, I don’t know how to move on from this. It’s almost been a month. Her friend says she is fine, but said that even when she wasn’t because She told me she wasn’t, not her( her friend) . What should I do? My friends akways say to move on because it’s her choice even if it isn’t right. But I just can’t stop thinking about it and her. And she is going abroad too to where he is. Her mom doesn’t know. She lost her dad a long time ago. She’s socially awkward. I love her immensely. Tell me what to think.",2019-12-05 17:24:05

I was thankfully not fully in the questioning phase when I started my relationship, but I definitely struggled with people outside of my relationship presuming my gender and assigning my relationship as straight (I can confirm I am a very gay trans man).

The absolute best thing you can do is just let your partner discover themselves and come to you. I’m sure they’re comfortable coming to you when/if they’re ready. Be supportive of their visual/social changes, and just casually compliment them here and there. You don’t need to make a big deal of it right now, as your partner seems very comfortable to explore their identity and feels safe to be open about it.

You both seem like people who are openly supportive of trans individuals and extremely supportive of friends no matter their place in transition. You sound absolutely lovely and ready to be there when or if your partner comes to you about this. But from what I can tell your partner is exploring their femininity more and you’re both comfortable.

There’s no need to rush their feelings, so just allow yourself to be patient and supportive. Your relationship sounds absolutely beautiful and  loving. Exploring ones identity is an organic process and once it feels natural then your partner may come to you. You have nothing to worry about or rush, just continue to love your partner and support their changes (maybe even offer to do their makeup or nails to show your support without outright rushing a conversation).

The big thing I noticed here is that you are at 2 years and you said she doesn't have relationships last past then.  Digging to the root of this is going to be where your answer is.

It seems probable that she loses sexual interest after that amount of time.  This isn't a knock on her, it is very normal for sexual desires to change over time and decrease with the same person.

I say this because although it is going to hurt, you shouldn't feel like she is intentionally being a jerk to you saying she may want an open relationship.  I would look into some couple counseling to see if there is a middle ground.

Some of the best advice i got when I was married is that there will be good years and bad years in every relationship and that sometimes you just have to ride out the bad ones. Now this only works if you are both committed to seeing the relationship succeed. 

I am all for open relationships if both partners agree and talk about it extensively before anything happens. That being said I think your relationship is still new and you guys are not seasoned enough to handle the jealousy and guilt that come with being intimate with people outside of your relationship. You two need to try other things first. You said you are not as social anymore. It might be good to have a guys/ girls night where you hang out with your friends separately. Spend some time apart and when you come back home talk about your night out. Also plan date nights together, get dressed up, go out have fun together.

Why would you want to be with someone who seems to doubt their own decisions to a point that they are unhappy with them.  

Confidence in yourself and your choices breeds happiness.  

There are many people out there who make a choice, and don’t start to bend due to some short term feelings, they need concrete changes to a situation to do so because they accept those feelings as temporary...and with this thought of “this feeling is temporary, I’ll feel better down the road” comes peace and that feeling or lack there of passes.  

Our outlooks are self fulfilling prophecies.  If we have an outlook that everything is fine, our feelings will go in line until there is material reason not to believe that.  

Which means, when she gets those tinges of love for you, which I’m sure she still has, she will latch on to that and continue her thoughts down those paths.

No. Marriage never changes anything. In fact you made it harder to breakup because now it's a legal process.

You fix the problems first.

&#x200B;

> WTF DO I DO? Why am I not enough for this man?  

You don't marry a man that had pre-existing unresolved problems. 

Have a proper conversation. 

Ask: ""How much sex do you actually want? Are you actually interested in sex? (If yes, Why don't your actions reflect that?) Are you sexually attracted to me? What action will he take to fix this and when? 

All these questions and answers will probably lead to nothing. You both avoided solving them before, he will probably brush you off now. 

You married him expecting change. You made your happiness based on his future actions where he already showed failure and disinterest. 

He needed to change, for you to be happy, which is a formula for failure.

Be thankful that your bf is attracted to you for reasons *other than* his **natural and biased** attraction to red heads.

If a woman with K boobs walked by, you and your bf would be like ""*wtf?*"" He's probably not thinking of banging her, bit it's just impossible not to notice someone like that. Or if a naked woman seductively was being walked on a leash in front of you; that's human nature and curiosities.

A fetish would be to make you a British web cam model while driving a taxi and sucking your toes and he orgasms without you touching him.

>Go watch ""Anon"" . Really, some people live by the mentality of ""I have no need or cause to show you my phone, because it's mine, even if I'm not doing something bad, simply because I don't want to"". Personally I'm that way. If I'm with friends and they ""*need to use my phone*"" I'll ask them how. To check Facebook? Sure. Ill boot up the app and then pin it (because I don't use the app - I always access through browser incognito on my phone). They need to text someone? Tell me the number and I'll send the message. Need to call someone? What's the number, and once the call is started, I pin the call app. You will have zero access to anything of mine simply because I say so.

>My significant other and I had a geo app where we could see where each other was in case of emergencies, or if she got lost driving. Where we live is horrible cell reception so I will regularly turn off my mobile data because my phone keeps trying to switch between WiFi and data and it's annoying. One night I was going to hang out with some friends from out of town which I was dreading because they are annoying as fuck, and as I was leaving she says to me ""why is your location turned off?"" I immediately uninstalled the app and told her I was hurt, and when I got back we'd be having a conversation about how she doesn't trust me. She later admitted that she checked the app before I left to make sure she could see where I was, because I never go out. She knew I was going to hang with them (it was all over Facebook) but thought I might go ""do something else too"".

>You need to decide to trust them (partners/SOs/Friends), or don't. They have no need, requirements, or obligation to allow you access to their device other than to appease you. In relationships you pick your battles or in some circumstances you move on to a different battlefield.

Why? Because dead people should be revered and never called out for their asshole acts in life? Like we should all be like ""Oh maybe Hitler was an okay guy"" because he's dead now? No. That's not how this works. Your acts in life follow you into the grave and their families need to deal with that.

Trusting your gut doesn't always mean ending a relationship, but it does always mean something is off and needs attention. So many people in abusive relationships had bad gut feelings in the beginning and ignored them. Him telling you to ignore yours is a red flag. 

Abusive behavior goes in a cycle. First things are happy, normal, and good. Then tension starts building. People say they start feeling anything they say or do could upset the other person and they need to be cautious. Then there is an abusive act. This doesn't have to be physical. Could be emotional, verbal etc. Then they apologize, say it will never happen again, justify their behavior, etc. Then things are good for a while and the victim thinks it was just a rough patch, things are fine, etc. until it happens again. It will over and over and over. It will get worse over time. 

Maybe he isn't abusive, but there are some red flags. Telling you to ignore your gut instinct, pushing you, punching the wall to intimidate you, blaming past problems on you instead of taking accountability. There are definitely warning signs. Staying with someone who makes you feel fear is not a good idea. That's not how relationships should be. Feeling pulling together doesn't mean he is the one.

And as for the visions: I think  you are experiencing high stress and anxiety, and those are making your imagination run through every possible outcome that could happen to you if you stay with him. 

Anger problems don't change in 5 days, it takes years of hard work and therapy. Tumultuous relationships do not get better, they just get more toxic.

I read this as; you are a well intentioned and career driven man building a life for himself and his future wife. You probably show love through acts of service and being a provider, but this clashes with her view of how a relationship should be? 

Be honest with yourself about the relationship and ask yourself the hard questions.

You said it was far from perfect from the start.
How so? Maybe more info would help?

Can you see red flags looking back? Personality conflicts? Immaturity? Codependency?

Do you feel you’ve put the relationship on the back burner to your career? Why? Why do you feel that you have to put her first in life? Does she do the same for you?

Why no marriage proposal before now? Are you subconsciously unsure about her or waiting for her to change/mature?

Do you see her as a partner? You hint that you feel like the division of labour in the relationship is unfair?

You started together quite young. Is this growing apart or “the seven year itch”?

Maybe your drive and ambition makes the two of you incompatible? Are you both willing to reach a work/life compromise?

Good work on trying to identify and take ownership of your own mistakes. This is a very mature attitude to have. Just make sure it’s mutual and you don’t let yourself become a punching bag!

Relationship dynamics change and people’s needs can change. Starting as young as you have, you need to make sure you grow together and not apart.

Plus now that she’s done that you’re probably not gonna trust her to give you the privacy you need. Since there’s no trust on either side of the relationship it’s probably better to give it a mercy kill than to let it continue making the two of you endure it. Hopefully this way she can go get her insecurities resolved with a professional while you get to not be in a relationship where you have no guarantee of privacy.

We all have a set of boundaries, and those get tested all the time in relationships. Sometimes you can shift your boundaries for someone you love, but if their behavior is completely unacceptable, this probably is not the person you want to be with.

>Go watch ""Anon"" . Really, some people live by the mentality of ""I have no need or cause to show you my phone, because it's mine, even if I'm not doing something bad, simply because I don't want to"". Personally I'm that way. If I'm with friends and they ""*need to use my phone*"" I'll ask them how. To check Facebook? Sure. Ill boot up the app and then pin it (because I don't use the app - I always access through browser incognito on my phone). They need to text someone? Tell me the number and I'll send the message. Need to call someone? What's the number, and once the call is started, I pin the call app. You will have zero access to anything of mine simply because I say so.

>My significant other and I had a geo app where we could see where each other was in case of emergencies, or if she got lost driving. Where we live is horrible cell reception so I will regularly turn off my mobile data because my phone keeps trying to switch between WiFi and data and it's annoying. One night I was going to hang out with some friends from out of town which I was dreading because they are annoying as fuck, and as I was leaving she says to me ""why is your location turned off?"" I immediately uninstalled the app and told her I was hurt, and when I got back we'd be having a conversation about how she doesn't trust me. She later admitted that she checked the app before I left to make sure she could see where I was, because I never go out. She knew I was going to hang with them (it was all over Facebook) but thought I might go ""do something else too"".

1659,f9rfjrl,e6jlrn,Kinetic42,1575575622.0,2,"The way you describe your bf is how I have been described by some of my former partners. I don’t know him; however, I have severe ADHD and it isn’t a matter of I don’t want to remember those things or that my former partners were unimportant, but rather, the way my mind worked, it just didn’t retain that information. Slipped right out. Doesn’t matter how “smart” I am, memory isn’t a function of intellect. 

What works for me is medication, lists, and reminders. Post it notes are great because I can write things down and then throw them out when they’re done. I get cluttered and unorganized easily, and have hoarder tendencies because I’m afraid of throwing something out that I actually need but forgot it’s purpose at this time, because of times I’ve thrown things out that were needed or important to other people. 

One of the great weaknesses of this unorganization of our minds is the inability to prioritize “in the moment.”  It’s not that we can’t do it, rather, it has to be written out in advance to be organized. Each issue you’ve described is classic adhd behavior. 

If these things sound similar to your bad, than let me give you some ideas that might help. 

First, he has a one track mind. What that means is that he can only focus on one thing at a time. I know the “commonly held belief” is that adhd people can do many things at once, and that’s true, but that’s because our brains are constantly throwing tangents at us. If we lose our grip on our one thing, we lose it entirely. If we are focusing on one thing, we don’t have the mental energy (absent medication) to hold that second thing without losing the first.

Second, medication helps, but only to a certain degree and the side-effects may be worse on your relationship than the adhd. One of the most common side-effects is mood change. For me that comes out as a loss in my ability to relieve minor stresses, to the point that they build up and I become “snippy” and “aggressive” over a period of time. I’ve learned to use the mediation as a tool to get tasks accomplished, but to not use it all the time to avoid these side-effects. 

Third, lists, lists lists. Make a list with him, daily, weekly, monthly. Make HIM write it down on the list. Where on the list is unimportant to people with adhd. We don’t prioritize lists by order of importance beyond the first 1-2 items. The rest are the junk we keep in our head. By writing them down we remember them better and we can prioritize better. No amount of you writing down or making lists for him will help. It will generally be detrimental to him because he then has your list, not his own. 

I understand this sounds like a lot of work, and frankly, you aren’t under any obligation to do any of it. He should take care of it himself. The issue is he either doesn’t know how or can’t. It isn’t your burden to carry unless you want to though, and if you want to carry that, I believe this will be a good way to start. 

Remember, what works for me (or someone else) may or may not work for him. Something will though, if you are both willing to try. It’s a long process and if the first things don’t work, you have to be willing to try many different approaches until you find one that works and that you can live with.",2019-12-05 19:53:42

""Oh I found this new thing, and my brother and I hung out, etc""  Then as things get more comfortable I tell her whats bother me. It isn't like 21 questions, and no one will know. You tell them exactly what you are comfortable with. It's obviously more helpful if you share but you don't have to go below the surface until you are ready. It is confidential and they could get destroyed by the law if they ever let it slip.

1763,f9qk3pv,e6j7qs,ohrain95,1575562452.0,1,"Therapy is in fact a lot of trial an error. You might not get along well with the first therapist you meet. You might find after a few sessions you really click with each other and it works out. The important thing to remember is that you can ALWAYS find another therapist, but therapy does take time. 

Your therapist will gradually build you up to a point where you will be okay with beginning to open up about more personal details. They are not (and should not) be there to make you feel judged or pressure you into revealing information that you aren't ready to address.

That being said, therapy only works if you go into it with your arms open. You do have to be willing to try - you don't have to be excited about it, as it will be hard, but it's only meant to benefit you and the other's in your life. 

You do not have to disclose to anyone that you are seeking out therapy. And honestly, anyone who judges you for doing so is probably insecure in themselves. Yes, there's stigma about it, but are you going to let that be the reason you don't seek out a service which might greatly positively impact your life? Everyone is different in their personality - there's being private (which is okay) and then there's being so closed off it starts to effect your relationships and overall happiness. Being a private person is okay, but I hope you feel like you do have people you can open up to if you need to. 

As far as cost goes, when you start looking for a therapist, ask if they have any affordable options for a patient paying out of pocket. A LOT of therapists will work with you to find a reasonable payment plan. You may qualify for sliding-scale or free services as well, depending on your income/situation. If you live near a university/graduate school with a psychology program, you can also look into cheaper services by working with students or someone who is in training, instead of someone who may be really well established and therefore really expensive.",2019-12-05 16:14:12
1764,f9qkxbo,e6j7qs,SaltySyrvantez,1575562846.0,1,"So there are several things here that you should consider. First of all, HIPAA regulations dictate that your therapist cannot disclose information unless you are a danger to yourself or others (e.g. threatening murder or suicide) so whatever they put in that file is only releasable to you or other doctors whom you authorize. When you read through the forms they give you to fill out on intake, you can usually find the HIPAA disclosure one and get more information from there. Personally, I like to advise people to go to credentialed therapists, this helps avoid the pseudoscience peddlers that actively harm their patients with misinformation.

Next, most states, cities, and counties have their own departments of health, and many of those operate on what are called ""sliding scales"" for fee structures. Basically if you are uninsured and struggle financially with the cost, they can reduce it down - for some people all the way to being free depending on your income. Try to contact the one that serves your community, there's several with websites, but usually you can at least find a phone number.

Lastly, there's always a risk of incompatibility with your therapist, but you should try to ask some questions when selecting one. Try to ensure they are empathetic to your personal or religious views as this tends to be very sensitive to some people. I would also say that the societal stigma is all but gone in many younger communities, to the point where it is common for people in their 20s and 30s to be talking about things they learned or did in therapy. This can be as private or public as you want it to be, you are under no obligation to disclose that you're going to anyone (aside from your wife, I'd recommend not keeping her in the dark about it). Try to dedicate yourself to getting the most out of therapy, be brutally honest and be open to listening to them and their advice and observations.",2019-12-05 16:20:46
1765,f9ql8ga,e6j7qs,DinahTook,1575562997.0,1,"You wont go lay on a couch and unload every bad memory you can think of.  

You will go in for your first appointment and fill out some paperwork, a bit like going to a new doctors office. Then you will go into the therapy room and take a seat.  This appointment will be a bit like an interview talking about what your goals are for therapy, what the therapist's ideas are to help you...  in general just seeing if you are a good fit to work together.  If it doesnt feel right it is ok to ask if they would recommend someone that can help you towards your goals.  It isnok for someone to be a great therapist but not be someone you connect with or has a plan you feel comfortable trying.  

After that think about it a bit like going to the dr.  It important and helps you deal with any problems that may pop up, problems already there, and otherwise offer a good way to help keep things from getting bad (like when a dr says your cholesterol is a bit high so you may want to focus on what you eat to prevent it from being a bigger issue).  

You dont have to have massive problems to benefit from the support a therapist can offer.  They arent there to make you feel bad or guilty for not having more wrong.  Instead they are there to help you build on your positives so you can address the negatives in a healthier way.  They will help you build a tool box for taking better care of your mental and emotional well being.

Everything is confidential and wont be discussed with anyone unless youa re the one talking about it.  No one even has to know you are ein therapy.  

It really does help to have someone who isnt involved with issues you are experiencing to help offer a non biased impartial way to help you work through the issue and how to deal with it.

It sounds like you know they will be angry, and there's not going to be a way to tell them where they won't be angry. Nobody here is going to have the magic words to make them happy about this. This is your choice -- don't have the baby and keep your parents happy, or have the baby and let your parents be mad if that's how they want to be. It's *your* choice to make.

But you're an adult and you're allowed to make your own decisions. You don't have to sit and listen to them yell at you.

If they harass you, you can tell them not to contact you, and if they continue to harass you, you can go to the police and look into legal options.

I think your first step should be to say to yourself, maybe even out loud, ""I am having this baby. My parents will be angry about it. But I am going to have this baby anyway because I have the right to make that decision, even though my parents will be angry about it."" If that is your decision, then own it.

Support your wife in whatever way you can through the legal process of bringing her rapist to justice. Discuss separating, divorcing, and amicably coparenting as calmly as possible.

Dealing with the sexual violation of a loved one brings out a lot of complex emotions.  I don't know how to word this next part delicately, so I understand if this gets blasted, but here goes:

It's gonna be really hard to reconcile with the fact that your wife wouldn't have been in a situation to be raped by Jake if she wasn't having an affair with him.

> she had a purely romantic relationship for about a month

So this was an ongoing thing, involving consistent meetings/communication.

> She refused any sexual advances

So even if she wasn't physically cheating on you, she was continuing to hang out romantically with someone who *knowingly expressed sexual interest in her*.  She may not have been sleeping with him, but the thought wasn't turning her away from the affair.

> I really don't know. Ten years is a long time. I feel bonded to her

Excluding the rape (which she was in no way responsible for), your wife was consistently hanging out and communicating romantically with a guy, who repeatedly advanced on her sexually.  That's a textbook emotional affair *at the least*.  You may feel bonded to her, but she didn't feel the same way.

Wanting to support your wife through rape is an empathetic, understandable response to have.  However, if you aren't capable/the right person to provide her that support right now, I don't think anybody could call you a failure for it.  You aren't questioning the relationship due to her rape, you're questioning it due to her actions; I'd imagine if she had just been assaulted randomly on the street you would be way less conflicted, because the morality would be way more binary.",2019-12-05 19:51:40

To all the fucking idiots telling you to do nothing for her.  They are the least humane people of the fucking planet.  She is your god damn wife, and regardless of this betrayal, she needs your support.  You are not by any means obligated to support her, but only a piece of shit wouldn't.  

Your wife gets raped and you don't support her, that is by far a much much much much worse action than an emotional non-sexual affair.

No one is saying you have to stay with her after this betrayal.  But not helping her will define the type of person you are.  Anyone who thinks differently is a fucking moron.",2019-12-05 20:45:32

You know this stuff: you create a shared life, you comprise. You may not do things you may have otherwise chosen to do,  but if everything is balanced, you trust your partner to do the same, even if it doesn’t always make absolute sense. That’s one of the most beautiful parts of sharing your life with a good person- you can trust that they’ll have your back, even if you may not deserve it. That’s mercy.

The dealbreakers come when you disagree with introducing an element to that shared life. If you’re kind, you avoid situations  where you force your partner to have to choose between staying with you, and living with something that may be intolerable. Ideally, you would have worked that out at some point in the previous quarter of a decade. I can’t imagine me and my husband having this problem because after all this time if something comes up and he needs something from me, I choose him. Always. Everything else is extraneous. Sure, I factor that into my decision making (and if I were a middle school girl I’d call it control) but he’s worth it. It’s the cost of doing the business of sharing a life.

Make no mistake: you are completely free to do whatever the hell you want. She just doesn’t have to be with you while you’re doing it. SHE has as well. As one of my friends says, you’re free to make any decision you want, but you’re not free to escape the consequences of that decision. 

Here’s the problem I have with your approach:  her ceding that portion of ‘control’ means she cedes the control to decide what she will or won’t allow in her life. Maybe she knows she can trust you intellectually but doesn’t want the anxiety. That’s reasonable. What is more sad for her, is  that you sound like this activity is important enough to risk losing her over. It must be something significant, indeed.

Speaking of reasonable- your reluctance to disclose what the issue is makes me suspect the issue is something the average person might take pause about. There’s different types of uncomfortable- safety, morality, fidelity. If I have to make a judgement call on whether to compromise, I like to consider how I’d feel if I were on the other side or how a reasonable person would feel. Is your wife reasonable? Is she controlling in the rest of your life? No? Then there is a good chance YTA.",2019-12-05 16:57:53

Background: my SO and I were together from the age of about 12 until about 15. We then got back together when we were 18, now both 22. 

In the in-between years we didn’t talk at all.  We had mutual friends who would tell us both updates of each other’s lives, but we had pretty much no contact. We just grew apart. 

We’ve both confessed now that we always wanted to reach out to one another, even if it was just to patch the friendship. But neither of us did. I thought he hated me. He had some crippling anxiety which went unchecked and unmedicated. 

Then one day I saw him while he was working. Ironically I was going into his work with my then girlfriend to get some lunch. He flashed me a cheeky smile from behind the counter but that’s the entire interaction at that point. I remember thinking about how cute he was. 

He messaged me on snapchat later that day and we got talking. We caught up on all the events we’d missed from each other’s lives the last few years. and it all kinda snowballed. All those feelings we had as kids came back tenfold. He confessed about them first. I left my then girlfriend for him. This happened over the course of week or so. 

After I broke things off with the girlfriend, he started staying over. Nothing was official for a few weeks. We just casually saw each other and messed around. Then we made it official after some very emotional, wine fuelled talks

Seriously domestic violence centre is the best. But I would consider hidden cameras. They need to be time and date stamped. Keep all footage until you've left, and even then keep it if you can. Lose your phone by accident or break it. Get a brick phone. And keep a phone at work if you need to.

Obviously they're are plenty of exceptions, but typically if you think about a one night stand you're not expecting a relationship. 

So you weren't exclusive, you were a one night stand who she was obviously attracted to and willing to see you again. Then you became exclusive and she hasn't seen anyone else since.

This is nothing to feel insecure about. Have you tried writing it out, and thinking about it from another person's point of view.

I don’t know what to tell you to get over it, I don’t think I could or would want to. I want the person I’m committing with to really want me. I’d want to know that after we started talking, that person liked me enough to want to immediately cut off other hookups. That’s the way I operated and I wanted a similar partner. If it was casual, I didn’t care, but commitment was a totally different thing for me. I didn’t try to turn casual into committed.

Marriage is basically a piece of paper and a ceremony with zero guarantee you'll even make ten years.

You can have a loving, committed, monogamous relationship without getting married. It's literally identical except for you don't have a random third party declaring you husband and wife.

Life is not a race. There's no medal for being married by 34 and as far as kids go, even if you can't carry, there are thousands of children needing good homes in the world, you guys could adopt. Also you really don't need to be married to have a child. 

Giving him an ultimatum is a terrible idea. He'll either leave you or marry you. If he marries you though, wouldn't you always wonder if the only reason he did was because of the ultimatum? And he could easily come to resent you over time for forcing his hand when he wasn't otherwise ready to get married.

If you really love this man, just celebrate what you two have together. But if all you really love is the idea of marriage and kids by a certain age, regardless of who it's with, then leave this guy alone and find someone more in line with those particular goals.",2019-12-05 15:21:46

His friends called him “Pizza face” cause it was so greasy and he literally never stopped picking at his skin and laughed when people suggested he wash his face. Ugh. He’s still one of my best friends today but UGHHH. He got married and his wife couldn’t even get him to take care of himself.

For your situation, I think his reluctance might go deeper into a confidence issue with the acne but of course we can’t get an accurate read on the internet and it seems like the issue stems deeper since his hygiene has always been an issue. Maybe try buying him something like Stridex wipes and leave them on the bathroom counter? That way he can at least be wiping his face down without physically having to wash it and that can help with the oil. 

I think the way it’s approached is going to be the key to success here. Playful without making him feel like he’s being attacked. If my current boyfriend doesn’t brush his teeth before bed I’ll say “I love you but your breath is awful.” If he doesn’t get up and brush his teeth I laugh and tell him to turn away from me and refuse to let him get near me. Usually that does the trick.

But also, I think this might be the place to be completely straightforward with him. Tell him this isn’t about the condition of his skin but you want to live in a clean space and him just cleaning up a bit more before bed is all you’re asking for. It’s going to be an awkward convo and he might take it the wrong way initially, but sometimes you have to be upfront about stuff like this.

She said the guy ticked all the other boxes and was too attractive for her to kick him out based on one issue, she was really superficial.

That is fucking crazypants to do.

You have love/feelings for every single person you are in a commited relationship with.  Love/feelings are not special, they are not a tick in the pro column, they are a basic requirement to be in a relationship period.

Its a basic bitch of dating.  It means nothing in the math of the relationship.

You would never be in a commited relationship with someone you had no feelings/love for, so why would you consider it when you are deciding to stay?

It makes no sense what so ever.

It would be like choosing between 2 cars that are the exact same car in every way, but the paint color, and you chose Car A, because it has wheels.  When Car B has the exact same fucking wheels as Car A.

It sucks, you will feel your feelings and you will move forward.

If you don't feel like every single long term relationship could be ""The one"" then you don't know how to date or you are some kind of robot person.  That is the whole fucking point, is that this one could be ""the one"" so let see where it goes.   Why else are you in relationships?

Every single relationship you have your entire life but ONE, is going to fail.  Its literally impossible for you to ever have more then one relationship go the distance.

The failures are the most important part because they teach you lessons that give you tools in your relationship toolbox.  Conflict resolution, heartbreak, compromise, how to weed out losers, bad fits, what kind of partner you want, what kind of partner you want to be ETC.  ALL of this you only learn through the failures.

Without these failures you won't have tools in your toolbox and you won't be able to recognize or maintain a healthy relationship when you find one.

So without the failures you will NEVER have a shot at the win.

If the sex hurts her down there, she’s probably not aroused enough prior to the actual sex act.

The sex was never anything wonderful (like it is with my current partner), but we loved each other and that seemed like enough. She never seemed fully aroused or enthused, it was always me initiating, and in the end I would always cum way too early for either of us to feel satisfied. 
It wasn't until earlier this year when we broke up and I started experiencing other goddesses that I realized, sexual chemistry can exist apart from personality chemistry. You can be a couple, be best friends, have similar interests & beliefs, but that doesn't guarantee you will be ideal sexual partners. Maybe that doesn't matter to you, but I realized spectacular sex is VERY important to me.  If your girl is fine with you experiencing other bodies and you don't wanna lose her at the same time, maybe get out there & feel the difference. Honestly, it was like night & day for me when I started sleeping with someone else: I can somehow last forever now, she orgasms, I orgasm (not just cum, there's a difference), the connection is staggeringly deep. 
I hope you get all the beautiful sex you want, because when the chemistry is a match, it's the best thing on Earth.

Clearly there's something going on with her lack of desire, and what sounds like excuses to avoid sexual situations (there are ways to address physical discomfort in sex!).  Rather, it seems likelier that there's emotional issues: perhaps she has some past trauma, or issues with depression or other emotional disorders.  Conversely, have you considered that she might just be... asexual?  She might have previously gone along with sex because she knew it's what you wanted, but is just sick of pretending at this point.  The fact that she wants to continue to be with you, and is ok with you sleeping with other women but not dating them, strongly suggest that she still is in love with you but she knows she can't (currently) give you what you need.

Talk to her, try to get her to open up about any possible (non-physical) reasons she's avoiding sex.  Maybe suggest couples therapy, if you think that might help.

This, in turn, will make you feel guilty for even sexually desiring your partner. Meanwhile, she is not finding a reasonable compromise or solution to help you find satisfaction in the relationship. You've offered suggestions and are enthusiastic and supportive about problem-solving. She doesn't listen. 

A lot of redditors here will say, ""she shouldn't have to have sex if she doesn't want to!"". 

Which is true. She doesn't. 

But I think it's a naive blanket statement. Being in a loving relationship sometimes means doing things for one another because you want to see the other person happy. Compromise is a key to success.

For example, I don't *want* to give me girlfriend a foot rub after a long day. But I bite the bullet and do it because it makes me happy to see her happy. And I know she does things for me all the time too. We love making each other happy - and sometimes that costs us a short-term L.

The weight of sex is different depending on different people, of course, but it should be her responsibility to look for a reasonable solution. For the sake of the relationship. She can't reasonably expect you to be happy here if you're not getting the physical component. That'd be bonkers.

Remember: when sex is good, it's only 10% of the weight of the relationship. When sex is bad, it's 90%. 

So, you need to have a frank conversation. Tell her that you are not getting what you want out of the relationship. It's not even all about sex, it's also about feeling love and affection. Sex, WITH HER, not other women, is part of that bigger equation for you.

Let her know that if she doesn't make a reasonable effort to remedy the problem (doctor's visit, therapy, etc) you'll have to leave. Tell her you'll support her through this, because she's probably somewhat frustrated with guilt too. She also sounds depressed.",2019-12-05 18:23:57

You said it yourself that you don't want her to think of you as some clingy guy. If you do anything other than giving her space, that is exactly how you will cement yourself in her mind. You say you don't want to just sit there and do nothing. But here's the thing bro: *you're not doing nothing*. You're giving her space. I'm not going to lie to you. The chances of her wanting to get back with you are low. However, the chances will be better for you if you just leave her alone, fake being okay with everything, fake being confident and secure about everything etc. 

Consider the relationship over bro. If fate brings you two back together great. But don't shut the door on the relationship permanently by acting needy. Hold your head up high and walk away. This is your only option. You can try all that other shit but the results will be the same, except you will feel even worse. Hold your head up high, king.",2019-12-05 19:08:36

I also cared about my partner, as you say your girlfriend does (or at least says she does). However, for no particular reason, the spark I felt for him went out. It wasn't because of the stress or another guy ... sometimes these things just happen. I was no longer happy in our relationship and I too, asked to go on a break (more on that later)

I guess what I want to emphasize is that she probably feels bad about this as well, especially if she doesn't have any specific reason for wanting it to end (like me), and it's on her mind too. Do *not* do the big romantic gesture- like other commenters have said, that would not win her back and almost certainly drive her further off. 

If you still find yourself really wanting to talk to her, wait until finals are over, and send her a brief message asking her where she feels you two are at. In all honesty, from what you've said, she probably will just formally break up with you, but at least you'll have closure, won't have disrespected her boundaries, and be able to start moving on.

That's what I wish my partner had done (he went for the grand romantic gesture, which ended our relationship then and there as I felt he'd totally disrespected my stated boundaries). I wish you the best of luck.",2019-12-05 19:46:47

2247,f9rko43,e6hw6h,harryhoudini66,1575577663.0,3,"Too long to read but no. The decision to break up with you was done long ago and she hinted at it the entire time. You just missed the hints. Once a woman tells you straight up for space or break, its done. There is no convincing her otherwise. Chances are there is another guy already lined up.

What you do is respect her wishes and know your self worth. Start working on yourself. Take on a hobby, reestablish friendships and hang with family. Maybe workout or anything in general of self development.

No matter what you mind tells you, listen to everyone that says you must give her space and no romantic gestures. I am sharing this with you only because I think it helps sell the reasoning. I was in an 18 year marriage and when it ended I chase and tried to win her back. Each time I did that it pushed her further and further away. It did not help that she had someone else lined up though but the chasing was counter-intuitive.

I ended up doing a ton of research on how to win her back. Watched hundreds of videos, read countless articles, books and audio books on how to win her back. They all said the same thing which was to give her space and start working on yourself. Many emphasize no contact being necessary. My therapist's advice and the advice of several others that went through the same thing told me to give her space and work on myself. Believe me I struggled so much with this advice and many times made the mistake of trying to win her back. When I won her back, I would lose her again within a couple of weeks. This cycle happened four times within the span of a year.

One of the best books and the one that provided the most healthy advice said the same thing about no contact, giving the other person space but had one additional caveat. It said to do all these things to actually get over the break up and learn to love yourself. It was not for the purpose of ""winning"" the other person back or to be manipulative.

I finally decided to stick to my guns and allowed the space. I worked on myself and stopped obsessing over her. In the end, she started reaching out to me frantically wanting things to work out and for us to reconcile but it was now me that did not want the relationship. During the journey of self development I gained lots of knowledge and ultimately learned to love myself. I learned about relationship attachments styles, codependency and lots of other things. Although this was now over 4 years ago, till this day she still tries to reach out and reconnect. This even though she had a kid with the new guy. They also have a toxic relationship and both are extremely jealous with each other. I however am much happier now and consider her ending the relationship an actual blessing although I did not see it that way at the time.",2019-12-05 20:27:43

I can imagine that feeling you've got right now. A lot of us can. But I wanna say I think the level-headed thing right now would be to give her space. I'm sure your mind is all over the place though and you wanna put it to work. 

I'd think about the things she said. What are the issues you guys have? I'm sure not all of it was a surprise. What parts were true? It doesn't have to be the entire exaggerated statements she might've made but there's usually a basis for them. Separate out the parts fueled by stress and anxiety.

Id say ready yourself for a talk. Process her feelings in the meantime. Be understanding as you do so with yourself and be ready to be understanding when you guys talk it out. 

While everyone has a preconceived idea of a break- and I generally don't like them either of course- in the end, it's a chance to give each other space and really think about your relationship. If you're gonna end things, this is where you mentally prepare yourself and get to looking ahead. Maybe you want it to end to. Maybe there's something better out there for you or some time being single would do you good! A relationship ending is a change to grow and learn. It's not all bad. It doesn't get rid of the good times you guys had and the things you learned.

But y'know what! Maybe you think about things she saod and decide she wasn't right. Maybe you guys do have a lot of interests. Maybe you find joy in participating in the other person's interests. I don't know. But be ready to have that talk with her. 

If you have to contact her now, tell her you're listening and ready to be patient and understanding. And when it's time and you're both ready you guys can talk it out. 

Maybe she misses you and the talk goes great. Or maybe you get to the talk and you realize you don't miss her. It's hard to keep the perspective after being with someone for so long, but being single can be a lot less stressful.",2019-12-05 19:31:57

So we made a deal that when we move hopefully end of feb close to March I can get a cat :)

It was absolutely stupid to just spring a puppy on you. Not only do you probably not know how much training to give the breed or temperament (is it a pit bull? A dalmatian? A lab? A rottweiler?), but he endangered your other animals. For now, kitty's fine, but probably won't be in a few months.

2291,f9r2ca7,e6hvh6,throwawaycontainer,1575570272.0,0,"Earlier this year, my wife and I got a 4.5 month old half-Dobie, half-German Shepherd. I work from home (wife doesn't work at home) so really bore the major brunt of the new dog. Having to constantly monitor the dog, deal with accidents (and all the weird smells associated with cleaning that up, in the place I both work and live), getting up multiple times per night to see if it needed out, etc.

The first two weeks were absolutely hellish for me. Turned my life upside down. An absolutely huge part of me wanted to throw in the towel and return her. At a certain point my wife stepped it up to give me a bit more of a break, and we got through those two weeks.

After those two weeks, things started getting better. The dog was more used to the place, so was less unhappy. She started figuring out some of the basic rules of what she was and wasn't allowed to do. We started figuring out her night-time schedule, so that it was less impact on my sleep. Things improved pretty rapidly after that point.

We're now 7-8 months past that, and absolutely adore her. She's come suuuuuch a long way.

A few things I would suggest:
-Get a crate if you don't have one already.
-Tell your boyfriend that if he wants to keep the dog, you need him to step it up a bit more and give you a break. Have your boyfriend watch the dog/vacuum/etc. for a few hours while you just go out and get coffee/have dinner on your own. Feel human again for a few hours instead of just being a doggy babysitter.

It's possible that the dog may just not be for you, but realize that you are in a period in which it's hardly abnormal for it to be hellish, but you are a decent chunk of the way through it already.

Good luck.",2019-12-05 18:24:32

There are only 2 choices with cheating and there will always only be too options.

If you have ZERO self respect you stay.

If you have a single ounce of self respect you leave.

Period.  None of the details matter, the past doesn't matter, the good times don't matter.  You don't cheat on someone you love and respect so to stay means you don't require his love or respect to be his human fleshlight.  Which is what you are to him, with the added bonus that you are self cleaning.

If you forgive cheating, you are giving that person 100% PERMISSION from you, to cheat on you moving forward.  Once you forgive something, that thing becomes forgivable.

So find your self respect and make the right choice.  

OR.

Get monthly STI checks at your doctor, because cheaters are liars and to expect a lying cheater to use a condom on his side piece is fucking ridiculous, he is bringing things home with him and giving them to you.

They are not just passed through P in V sex, orally they are also passed.  So even if you use condoms, unless he is using a dental dam and you are blowing him with a condom, you are being exposed to life changing sexual diseases.

So save yourself the trouble, if you're after a typical monogamous relationship, let him know and END THINGS.

Keep yourself to yourself if you can when she has him over to your flat, but at the end of the day the stuff that he has been saying about you is horrid and surely your friend can see how upset you are?  

Why not ask her to ask him why he loathes you so much, if his response is “she said you should dump me!!” Then maybe she should think about why you said that in the first place,  y’know the terrible behaviour towards your friend being the primary concern.  This is clearly about his insecurity of you telling his girlfriend to wisen up to his bullshit.

Men who feel the need to seek out attention from other women for their own ‘insecurities’ are often cheaters. Your bf’s boyfriend is likely cheating on her or at least seeking too. He wants to have his cake (your bf) and eat it too (fuck/flirt with other women). 

You gave her sound advice in telling her to break it off. She should try to run as far as she can. If the numerous red flags he constantly displays and the lies he tells about you can’t get her to leave I worry for what actually will finally make her leave. Her relationship is going implode eventually and it’s going to be messy. 

This is unfortunately a life lesson she may have to learn on her own. As her best friend you can be honest and tell you worry for her safety in this relationship. You may have to stop confiding in her about your private matters if she’s going to tell him everything. If she stops confiding to you because he’s manipulative, all you can do is offer to be there for her when shit finally hits the fan. God forbid, if she cuts off friendship, just reach to her often to tell her you think about her and care. 

As for rumors he spreads, just tell the truth every time one comes your way. He is maliciously telling lies about you and people shouldn’t  believe what he says because he’s untrustworthy. You could try confronting him to tell him to knock if off, but he’s probably the type that gets off on that in a sick sort of way. 

Your boyfriend is good guy, just be honest and upfront every time a new drama about dumpster fire boyfriend appears.

Farrell, your GF's childlike behavior and extreme sensitivity may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 4 other warning signs you have not mentioned.

The first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- or tried to isolate you away from close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER.

Second, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""

Third, you would not see her expressing her anger to total strangers (e.g., road rage against strangers). Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).

Fourth, you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on eggshells. Such flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. Have you been seeing strong occurrences of these 4 red flags?",2019-12-05 13:46:16

break ups suck, but they are part of life, and there are different ways to tell the truth. ""now that I know you, I don't like you"" - pretty harsh.

Mostly, we endured their flirtiness with a nice “customer service” smile bc their tips determine our income. I also worked in exclusively Asian restaurants and I can confidently say my coworkers who were Asian did not appreciate customers with blantant Asian fetishes. 
In the rare cases that someone dated a customer, it was generally a customer who came in to regularly and was kind, but did not try to flirt. I know a few relationships that started bc a regular customer and a worker had shared acquaintances and ending up seeing each other  at like a party or concert. 
In summary, if you like the food sure go back but just be polite, do not use the forced interaction of customer and worker as an opportunity to flirt or “get to know” these girls.

1. It can be hella uncomfortable for the person who's working. They just want to do their work and be done with it. However, if you are going to DO NOT ask for their number. Instead right your number down and give it to her. If she wants to move forward and get to know you she will call or message you. Nothing is more embarrassing and uncomfortable then having someone ask you for your number in front of other people or at your place of work where you cannot really hide.
2. Women are not super into when people fetishize them and while I understand you have a preference I mean everyone does DO NOT make that known ever. I went on a date with an Asian girl who HATED when guys only talked to her because she was Asian. I also have an inclination to Asiatic people but I make sure to remember these are people no matter their race/cree/religion/hair color (you get the point).
3. Just because someone is talking to you when you go and approach them at their work is not a full out sign that they want you. Going to bars women and I'm sure men too flirt with their customers to get tips and to show a little connection to build up service. Her being nice may just be her version of customer service.  


I hope all works out but don't be a creepy dude who makes a poor customer service employee feel uncomfortable. Offer her your number, if she does not message you don't take it to heart.

And if your worried about your daughter being around cancer and the possibility of losing someone, you shouldn’t.

Grooming is basically how someone in a more powerful position( in this case a much older guy that is with you cousin so somewhat ""in the family"") starts showing affection to a younger, less in power person.  Starts with comments, then affectionate touching and gifts.

Asking for input is a good trait in a relationship imo, but if she's feeling like it's too far and your willing to take more of a lead, then that's a good place to start. Keeping in mind to not let it go too far in the other direction though - any big decisions or things that directly involve her should still be talked about. It's good of you to care about her input but maybe take some comfort in the fact that she's open enough to raise an issue if she has it, so you don't have to be so accommodating. Sometimes it can feel like you're doing right by letting your partner pick, for example, where to go out for dinner that night. But it's also a pretty big stress to be the decision maker in every situation, and it's not really fair. 

My partner is extremely chill and has had controlling gf's in the past, so in the dinner example would constantly put the onus on me to choose and thought he was doing the right thing. But he didn't realise that after a long day of uni or work, the thought of making a decision as small as where to eat just sends me down an anxious spiral. Since talking it out we got infinitely closer and now coming home to him having already planned something like that all out just fillls me with comfort.

I always ask his opinion for everything, he is my future so even when it comes to doing new things I ask for his input as its not just me now I am thinking of him to. No matter how small I always communicate, he is happy with that. 

Some people like her don't want to be asked constantly for an input (probably whats going through those majority of peoples minds is, grow up you can make your own decisions)

Before I go on a ramble, I'm semi-recently out of a relationship where my ex was extremely dependent, so Im trying to not project, but I might be projecting a little.


I would start by taking time to look around for things that need to be done for at least a few minutes every day. Think about whether you need her help or just want to interact with her (ie, my ex asked for help filling out a questionnaire at the dentist about his issue. In his mouth. I had no answers. I think he just was annoyed I was on my phone). If you have something you need to do (forms, appointments, etc) do as much as you can on your own and then IF you have to ask for help.


People almost always link this comic about mental load for situations like this (I really relate to the part about the table)

I don't know how similar it is to your situation, but it might help you get some insight to why your girlfriend feels the way she does. With my ex I felt like I had 90% of the mental load, and he wouldn't listen when I tried to explain that I wasn't happy being ""in charge"" when we should have been a partnership. He wouldn't do anything unless I asked and even then it was iffy.


Maybe observe her routine is and find ways to make her life easier (does she start a load of laundry when she gets home? Can you start the coffee pot so it's ready when she gets up?). What are things that she does for you? You don't have to stop her from doing things for you entirely (especially if acts of service is her love language) but make sure you let her know you appreciate it.

2607,f9pwl2q,e6glp5,SaltySyrvantez,1575550487.0,2,"This is a good object lesson for you to remember in the future - people who have not developed emotionally have a very deep need of being reacted to understandingly when they test an emotional boundary, especially when they are clumsy in presentation. It's a great habit to develop to always question things that you feel upset by, often you'll find it's poor communication rather than a heartless offense. 

That being said, I think you should 1) find a new counselor, and 2) start trying with other topics first and circle back to this one. In a lot of ways it's going to work to your advantage to get him to open up to you in other areas of his life, his dreams, his insecurities, etc. and build up that valuable subconscious bias of ""oh well she's been cool about all this stuff I told her about my past, she'll probably be cool about this thing she's asking about"". Trust like that can be rebuilt pretty well depending on how quickly he can get over minor offenses or poor reactions.

I'd also say that your counselor is wrong, while that is a possibility for some people, being straight or bi or anything else has nothing to do with if someone will stay committed to an exclusive, monogamous relationship. That kind of conversation should ideally be one of open communication, where both of you feel like you can talk to each other if either of you starts feeling like they need to work through feelings or consider an open relationship.

lets assume she is real and as into you as you think you are into her (you're just fascinated and enamored that a girl is giving you attention - which in itself is *fine* but..)

these are my general rules for long distance relationships:

- don't do distance longer than you have been in a relationship in the same area (obviously you guys don't meet this pre-rec as you've never met)
- don't do distance with out an exact end date to the distance (you say 'at least two years' so, where is that time-line from)
- with the end date for the distance, have a specific plan. (ie. next august I'll be able to transfer to X dept. in the same town as you and with the money we've saved we can afford a two bedroom aptmt)
- rules and expectations - (# calls a day/week, # of visit month/year, hook ups yes/no, etc)

Honestly, it sounds like more trouble than it's worth.

However, I suggest you read more into depression and anxiety and not just antidepressants. Saying things like ""I've never seen him have anxiety or depression"" is a sign that you have some of the common misconceptions about those mental illnesses.

Going forward, respect his request for space. If he wants to discuss how he feels or things he has issues with about the relationship don't dismiss them thinking they're too minor. When you do that you're invalidating his feelings. Just because they're minor for you doesn't mean they're minor for him. Even if they're minor you should be having the discussion about how he feels, since there's nothing wrong with talking about feelings even if theres nobody at fault.

Be supportive, but respect his boundaries for as long as you can without it affecting your own mental health or until it's clear he doesn't want to continue the relationship and then move on.",2019-12-05 12:48:38

The bottom line is that you deserve better. Narcissists don't change, and you don't deserve to be treated that way. You deserve to be treated well.

If not, maybe ask: what would help you to walk away? Do you need to bring in a friend/family member for support? Would therapy help?

If she's lying that she doesn't have feelings for you when she does, there's not much you can do. It's up to her to admit that to herself or to you. You can't wait around hoping that she'll do so: you've already given her that chance and she hasn't taken it. 

The other two options are essentially the same thing from different angles. Either she doesn't want to share you with other people (selfish) or she's worried that if you have a girlfriend you won't still be able to be close friends (anxious). If you're being generous, you'll assume the latter. 

The solution is the same no matter what the reason for her behaviour is. She has said she doesn't want to date you, and you need to take her at her word. Tell her that when she starts dating someone, you hope the two of you will still be able to hang out / that you'll be able to get to know her boyfriend, that when you start dating someone else you hope she'll do the same. Make it clear that there will still be room in your life for her whatever happens. 

And then start dating other girls. Again, if she doesn't like that it's up to her to tell you why.

Second:

Whilst you've said you're aware you weren't perfect in all this, I don't think it's sunk in because you've gone on about how you're trying to be decent by still being her friend. You say you were still trying to talk **daily** to her until **she** blocked **you**.

That's not being decent. Honestly, it sounds like there's a huge amount missing from this story, and all of it is your engagement with this woman. 

You can't control someone else's actions, but you can control your own, and you kept engaging with her. You talked to her after she was inappropriate with you. She crossed boundary after boundary and for whatever reason, you let her. 

You didn't owe her anything after she planted a kiss on you that you didn't want, but you tried to take the blame for it so she wouldn't stop talking to you.

The bachelorette party was explained to be something similar...but one errant photo sent to the wrong person revealed a similar scene to what you experienced. 

He, unlike you, glossed over it. Excused it. Blamed the bridesmaids, etc. The wedding went on (which was incredibly awkward). They made it two years. He simply couldn’t trust her...and the mistrust was warranted apparently, for reasons other than the male stripper (that I won’t detail).   If it looks like a duck and so on.

About a year ago, a couple of our really good friends were getting married and my fiancé had been invited to the Bachelor party. During the planning for it, he had been informed that there would be a stripper. As soon as he got off the call he told me about it and asked me how I felt about that. After I told him I was uncomfortable with the idea (I didn’t like it at all - I don’t understand the reason that people who are about to get married to each other would subject themselves to that..) anyway, after I said that, he then said he didn’t like it either, and that he would leave before the stripper got there. 

Not only did he leave well before the Stripper got there, he also informed another guy who was in a LTR that there would be a stripper before the party and that guy was able to leave before she got there too. Also, because he left early, he did not have to help pay for her. (They all chipped in for all the events of the party - food, drinks, a motorbike ride, stripper.. etc..) 

Fast forward a year and we still have such an awesome relationship. I trust him and he trusts me and we know we love each other. 

Our friend who was the recipient of the stripper is still married and I’m not too sure his wife knows there was a stripper there. Pretty sure she’d be upset if she knew. 

Anyway, I said all that to say l, please don’t lose hope in finding a good relationship for yourself. Take it easy for now, be single, but please, don’t count it all loss for a good relationship. It can happen.",2019-12-05 15:47:57

I dated a string of women who were truthfully more broken than I was, while my ex got to move on in happiness. What I've come to realize nearly 16 years later is that this was never meant to be a race. We all figure it out in our own time. 

It took me almost eight years to meet the woman who would eventually become my second wife. And believe me when I say, I somehow almost managed to screw that one up in the very beginning too. Thankfully though I pulled head on straight and started focusing on the things that mattered, and I've now got the best partner I could have ever asked for. Neither of us are without our flaws, but where we are lacking, thankfully the other is able to cover for it.

Surprise: Three years later we’re getting a divorce. I know (probably more than most) how awful, humiliating and devastating this is, but you did the right thing. Cheating before a wedding indicates the person you’re marrying isn’t fully committed and that’s unlikely to change. In my case, my husband continued to arrange for sex with strangers - including while I was going through IVF - and this divorce has likely been more brutal than canceling the wedding would have been. 

Yes, people will know that your fiancé cheated on you, but you won’t be known as the person who got cheated on with a stripper. You’ll be known as the person who had the strength and courage to do the right thing and avoided years (at least) of this behavior continuing and the heartache that goes along with it. People will admire you for your decision WAY more than they’ll feel badly for you. And the next girl you meet will view this as a cautionary tale about what you’re not willing to put up with. 

I’m so sorry you’re going through this and I’m glad you have a strong support system in your family and friends. Lean on them even when you feel like it’s too much - it isn’t, and they want to be there for you as you work through all this and process what you need to.

Confronting people directly is hard but her being able to see your hurt and you telling her your feelings isn't a bad thing. You being able to express to her how devastated you are  can be extremely cathartic for you. You can begin the healing process. As it is it's like you experienced a death and didn't have a funeral or wake.

In The Iron Giant, the Giant often had things break in him, but they always ended up finding their way back to fix him. Sometimes it was something small and the fix didn’t take too long. At the climax of the movie, however, the Giant takes a hit from a nuclear missile and is shattered across the planet. Months later Hogarth gets a bolt from the Giant as a keepsake, only to find that the bolt begins moving and pointing towards the Giant to be rebuilt once again.

2814,f9qkl3z,e6fs4c,I_am_lonely,1575562684.0,39,"Okay, so this is all conjecture, but I'd love to play devil's advocate and give a possible different read on this story based on details I noticed in the original post. Before I continue I just want to make clear that if this crossed a line for OP, that's totally fair and he shouldn't get married. But I think there's a chance the truth could be different than what we're assuming, and that maybe OP is unnecessarily blowing up his engagement.

So, my first point that becomes relevant later: I think OP may come from a conservative (literally conservative, not necessarily politically) community. The first indicator was this language:
>  I'm not a super model, but I'm decent. **I don't act like a bitch or a pussy.** 

Whether or not you agree with that language, it's something you hear a lot less in ""woke"" blue cities. I'm not criticizing the language, stay with me here. Other details that indicated a religious or conservative community were the close family relationships on both sides, the bridesmaid's husband's feeling that it was his responsibility to inform all other bridesmaids' husbands, and especially the ""hero"" bridesmaid being so uncomfortable that she had to leave. In truth, if behavior like this happened at a bachelorette party, I would be uncomfortable and maybe leave the room, but I definitely wouldn't leave the party. I might make my objections known, or try to suggest to my closest friends that they shouldn't be doing this, but I wouldn't bail at that point, because I'm not very prudish. But I think a conservative/religious woman might. Which leads me to the next detail that doesn't add up...
> Basically long and weeping cousin story short; I found out Jane did indeed give a stripper a hand job, **along with several other women**, some of whom are in LTR's or married.

Now THIS was the most obviously strange detail. Do we think this stripper ejaculated ""several"" times from drunk-bridesmaid-handjobs? I'd say no, leading me to believe that somewhat-conservative OP has a different definition of handjob from me. I'd consider it a prolonged period of stroking, usually ending in climax, but I think what may have happened is the girls got a little wild with the stripper and maybe gave him a stroke or two each as a dare or an ""I'll do it if you do it"" or a ""look how crazy we are"" moment, laughing and giggling and screaming, and OP considers that a handjob, as does the conservative bridesmaid who went running home.

The requests for reconciliation from the fiancée's uncle and mother indicate that perhaps the fiancée's behavior was wrong but morally gray. Of course the fiancée could have lied, or have crazy relatives, but I think they'd be more more likely to reach out in the case of ""I touched a strippers dick"" than ""I cheated on him"".

And finally, I just wanted to note - a lot of people in both threads argued ""if she gave a stripper a handjob and then went to a strip club, she DEFINITELY did more than a handjob at the strip club."" I just wanted to say for the sake of argument, it's totally possible she didn't.



So, is it possible that OP is blowing up his engagement because his fiancée touched a stripper's dick for 10 seconds as a dare? I say it's not only possible, but looks likely to me (mainly because of the ""several women gave him handjobs"" thing - like, I doubt they all made him cum, and i doubt they made him cum at all because I don't see these women being comfortable enough to make a man cum in front of their friends and colleagues, especially the fiancée in front of her soon-to-be cousin in law, so I really think when OP says handjob he means ""touched a dick in front of her friends"").

So why did I write this? I mean, if this version of the story still crosses a huge line for OP, that's totally fair - end your engagement bro. I wrote this for the commenters saying ""you did the absolute right thing, block her, ghost her, move on!"" Even without the stretched ""conservative"" details, I'd hope more people would see the red flag of the ""several women giving handjob"" and think more critically. If she really did just touch a stripper's dick for 10 seconds, would you encourage this guy to end the engagement?  Or would you suggest he work through it. Would you blow up your own?",2019-12-05 16:18:04

That's okay. I can't dwell on the future or what could've been, because it doesn't fucking matter anymore. What matters is **YOU**. Be sad, that's okay too! But when you think about her and all the good times, just remember that she isn't real anymore. 

Start going to the gym. Lift weights. Run. Swim. Whatever interests you. If you already do some sort of physical activity, do more of it. Don't worry about finding another girl or getting on Tinder or whatever. Be alone for a while. Work on yourself and find some inner fuckin' peace. I can't stress how important is to face what happened, learn acceptance, and **then** find someone new, rather than finding someone new to numb the pain of being alone and betrayed. I'm not saying you'll do the latter, but it does happen **A LOT**.

The friends people surround themselves with says so much about them. I can't understand the desire to have a party like this while in a relationship or before starting a marriage. It should be a celebration of what's ahead, not of what you could be missing out on. I'm super old school and very monogamous as well, so I would have felt so uncomfortable! As a woman I also feel its disrespectful for the person you are with also, to have someone who cares about you but you are looking and touching another man!

I understand that the situation is shitty, but don't think that it had anything to do with the actual stripper. These actions are usually directed at anyone filling that sexual space. I'm saying don't think that it's because of the guy's personality as you said in your previous post, nor his body type, etc etc. He was a sexual object at the time, the same way that a one night stand would be to someone that doesn't frequently have one night stands. (Just IMO)

In any case, the reason I say this is because of your last paragraph about taking a hiatus from LTRs. I say because I can see traces of MGTOW rhetoric, and I'm just worried you may be swayed by the whole ""women just want Chads and only serve to complicate our lives etc etc""

First of all, I hear how sad you’re feeling, and my heart goes out to you. But I also read in the other post how insecure you’re feeling, how your confidence is shot, how it hurt your soul. You need to understand that what she did was a pull of energy with him, nothing more. It is so natural for us to want to explore energy we have with someone (alcohol induced or not) and because most of us don’t know a healthy way to experience that pull, it becomes sexual. There’s a good chance that if you were in the same situation and felt it, you might have done the same thing. But regardless, know that it wasn’t a judgment call where she found him more attractive than you or that you weren’t enough for her. It was probably more like the energy of hearing a good song on the radio and wanting to dance to it. I’m not excusing her behavior, I just want you to know that it wasn’t in any way related to you or the kind of man you are, or even how attractive you are. She was pulled, she didn’t know what to do with it so she went with it. This is all about her. Not you! You don’t need to become more and you don’t need to avoid another relationship, just use this experience to grow and that means continuing to grow and date people who are also growing and evolving. Look for shared values, shared willingness to evolve. Just because you two weren’t the match you thought you were doesn’t mean YOU aren’t enough, it just means you didn’t find someone aligned to you. Keep being the amazing you and you’ll eventually find someone at the same wavelength that you could see making a long term commitment to grow and experience life with.

I could gonon for ages why its hard, but i won't do that here, PM me for more in depth if you want. The less specific things go roughly like this: we use our bodies to earn a living, spend time with our loved ones, help our loved ones, etc. When that *feels* like it's taken away, you feel useless, like a drain. Lots of people distance themselves when this happens, out of concern for being a burden. Hes probably still in shock anyway. Frankly until you can do the things you used to with any level of success, it's hard to see that you can adapt and overcome. The brain has to rewire (thus the phantom pain and twitching, etc.) but that's just a piece of it. You also have to learn new balance, new methods, new skills, and you feel less attractive, so new confidence. I actually posted about this about 2mos ago lol. When you think you'll never have good work again, never be as good in bed again, never be able to handle physical tasks for your partner or family, always be holding them back, there's part of you that wants to give up and let them find happiness. I'm on a support group on fb (yeah, I know...fb...) But it helped a ton, and his Amputation is surprisingly common, with plenty of people to help and be positive and give advice, and it's open to people in relationships with amputees as well. The physical pain, especially with two large amps, is excruciating the whole way tbh, even after ""full"" recovery. Sockets cause blisters and worse, bone spurs can be digging through you're flesh into the socket, falls happen often while relearning your new body, etc. It's an emotion ordeal too. I'd equate it to losing a loved one. I honestly mourned my hand. Like, Sat and reminisced internally and cried. There's also the factor of learning the true meaning of permanent. I remember about 36 hours after my surgery I realized that I didn't keep my pieces, as I was drugged up when they told me no, and forgot until I was back on a similar drug for the post op pain (state dependent memory I guess) and freaked out, cause like, that's ME. A PIECE. OF. ME. That was taken, and discarded, incinerated, and just forever gone. I barely made it through all that shit tbh. While his response is indeed illogical, it's quite common. I hope this helps you see his perspective so that if/when you get back in touch, it'll be easier to relate and talk about it. Don't pressure him this soon after, ride it out for a bit until you hear he made a milestone like taking a step again, or getting fit for a prosthesis, etc, and congratulate him and let him know you're still there. Hes probably feeling super confused, scared, insecure, agitated, regretful, and so much more. Not to mention the near death experience, that shakes people up too, so he got a double dose of mindfuckery. It's not easy for either party, just hard in different ways.",2019-12-05 12:34:58

He lost vision completely in one eye (not as bad as your fiance, but my dad was a bus driver for a living and didn't know if he could continue making living/provide for my mother). In the hospital, almost every day, he would tell her to go find another man that was able to raise kids properly and provide for her. She would listen to what he said and come back every day because she didn't care what he said. I don't know how else she helped him through because I know there's more to the story (my parents don't talk much about their past). Judging from today, she helped him realize that he could live a completely normal life. He's actually able to drive today because the other eye's field of vision extended to cover his blind eye. The brain and the body are amazing things.

I think this should be discussed with his therapist and you should also ask for advice from the professional on how to help him.

There are many amputee and paralyzed online personalities out there who show that you can live a fulfilling meaningful life even with a severe disability, maybe you should consider looking up some of them. The first who pop into my mind are Nick Vujicic (born without limbs, married with kids), Alex Lewis (lost all limbs and suffered damage to his face due to infection, married with a kid), but I'm sure there are many others out there, too. The youtube channels Special Books by Special Kids also has a few videos specifically about couples where one party has a disability, often which are permanent and require care for the rest of their life but they are perfectly happy! It can be managed, it's just a new normal.

I'm hoping that he's sought help, such as therapy because there are going to be quite a few things that he hasn't thought out.

It's a horrible ordeal that he is going through- with a life changing amputation and no support from his own family, his self worth might be pretty low so it may have seemed like the best thing to do would be to try to force the OP out- people who have been abandoned often react by pushing others away because it's less humiliating than expressing the full extent of their need and vulnerability.

If you fully give up on him, you will be another person in his life who turned their back when the chips were down. If you want the relationship to rebuild, find a way to keep him notified that you still love him and want him to be involved in your and the baby's life. Maybe if he sees that you aren't going anywhere, he will be able to find his way as a partner and parent.

You can be there for him but your entire life can’t be him. I think it’s important to let him know you care about him and you value any time you get with him, talking or in person, but you have a life outside of the relationship. You want him to be apart of that life but that it’s not realistic for him to be the entire thing. Just let him know you’ll be there for him when you can and ask him if that’s okay or not. 
(Edit: ask him if it’s okay or not as in, if it isn’t - maybe you guys don’t have a lot of compatibility and should discuss breaking up? There are different levels of attention that someone needs and maybe his don’t match yours. Which is fine! If that makes sense.)

Tell her, that it's too much for you at the moment and that you'd love to stay friends, but that you need a few months (yes, months) without contact to get over her. 
Then take some time to get over your heartbreak. Grieve, be mad, write letters that you don't send. Get in contact with old friends, reestablish your other social contacts, talk to your family.

2998,f9pliuk,e6f4c2,ManonBlackbeak,1575541426.0,2,"I was in a similar situation last year. Me and my ex-boyfriend dated for a year and broke up mutually due to distance. We just didn't see a LDR working out in university. We were close friends for 3-4 years prior to dating, so needless to say not only did I lose a boyfriend, I lost one of my best friends. But we decided to maintain the friendship. An important thing we did however, was going no contact for a while. More specifically it lasted 3 months for us, but truthfully it should have been longer. I was very much in love with him, and 3 months were not enough for these feelings to fade. So the first thing I'd recommend you do is go no contact, give each other space and try to revive the friendship when you feel ready. 

As for reviving the friendship, it will be awkward. I was the first to reach out, in the beginning he seemed really disinterested, but I persisted. We somehow got to a point where we started texting daily, but not too much, just a few memes here and there. We even hung out a few times. But a few months later we ended up hooking up and started a sort of FWB relationship. I have to admit there are still feelings on my part and I'm not putting myself in a healthy situation right now. My point is, your friendship won't and can't go back to the way it was. It will always be easy to slip back into a sexual relationship, healthy or not, you will never be able to discuss certain topics without provoking negative emotions in each other, you can never be too close. At least not until a few years have passed and everything is completely behind you. But that takes a lot of time. 

I am not completely healed yet, despite the fact that it's been a year and some months since we broke up. I am feeling insanely better however. I know you've heard this a thousand times, but time heals. Time away from her, time spent creating new memories. You will feel shitty for a while and there's nothing you can do about it.

3204,f9s6evk,e6evbf,TacomaWA,1575586663.0,1,"In life, some people build idealized situations of the ways certain things should go. This especially happens with marquee life moments like weddings, births, graduations and more. They create this perfect, almost Hallmark moment, of how things will play out. It is beautiful...

...but it is also complete fantasy. Life is messy. Nothing is ever perfect. And, when the messiness of life happens and these ideal visions fall apart, people are hurt... and they do and say really stupid and hurtful things. They do this even though their vision of things was never realistic in the first place.

Many times, the person who has done this shakes it off and comes to their senses. Sometimes, as you can see from the drama exhibited in the many stories on this list surrounding weddings, births and the like, they do not.

So, what to do? I think you and your husband need to talk it out with her. Every birth is special. What is she saying if she says this one will not? Plus, there is a whole lot of life between now and any potential birth. Life is best when you aren't thinking happiness will come from some future unspecified occurrence. Be here now. Live life now. 

Ultimately, your husband is responsible for his parents. Yes, you should be there, but if they are hurtful to you, hopefully he will take the lead to resolving it. That is what you deserve. Similarly, you would be the lead with your parents. 

Then, if your future mother-in-law does come around, I would hope you could try forgiveness. Sometimes people do really stupid things. Redemption is a powerful gift you can give... Of course, it must be earned.

I think if you approach the situation by explaining what you were going through at the time and why you made the decision that you did, then it might help her to understand you instead of judge you. I hope that you had a really good reason for making the decision that you did. Personally I cannot imagine giving up a child and don't understand how any mother could part with their baby, no matter how difficult raising them might be. Because of this, I think there may be more to what she is feeling than she is letting on. It's hard to believe that it's just about it not being your first. That seems odd. Maybe you can delve into it and see if she is judging you for more than just that, which I think might be the case. 

Either way, I think that if you are respectful and try to get her to understand your POV and what you dealt with at the time, then she may come around. Maybe if you let her know that it was a difficult decision that you struggled with (assuming you did - if it was easy and you didn't really care, I wouldn't tell her that), then she may turn toward sympathy for you instead of condemnation.

Overall I think it's best to be nice to her. You will get a lot farther than if you come off as super offended, angry, and dismissive of her feelings. She has every right to be concerned and upset. This is brand new for her and it's her son's future that she is concerned about. My mother always said that mothers with sons are always a little... overbearing. Having a son now myself, I totally get it. I thought I didn't want a boy before I had him, but damnit if I'm not extremely grateful that I have him as my son. He's a really wonderful person and I look forward to a lifetime of a wonderful relationship with him as he grows.

I get jealous over girls he talks to that are friends that he's been interested in in the past though I get over it for the most part because I know that's me being insecure and that he isn't doing anything to disrespect our relationship or cheat but if he EVER said those things to another girl, especially one he was interested in and if he continued a friendship with her when she calls him like that and calls at 1 am, I would absolutely feel disrespected. 

He's not an idiot, he knows that is inappropriate behavior and if he is an idiot, you voiced your feelings about it so he knows he's crossing a line. He continues which means he doesn't care. He cares more about continuing this inappropriate behavior / relationship with her than he does about you, your feelings and your relationship. 

I would have a hard time accepting that truth but I'd have a harder time trying to pretend it wasn't true and trying to make it work with him.

First of all: Man, you gotta get your own social support system. I know that's easier said than done, but for a well-functioning relationship both partners need friends aside from their significant other. You're also putting a lot of pressure on your girlfriend when you rely on her being there for you that much. She obviously feels guilty spending that much time with her friends during school breaks when she knows that you're just sitting there, waiting for her. She cares about you, but she shouldn't feel obligated to cut her time with her school friends short for you. 
Secondly, her depression. She has a lot to deal with right now. Depression is a severe mental illness and she'll need all her resources to fight against it. That means you, but also her family and all her other friends. I think it's great that you're ready to support her. Ask her, what she needs. Be there for her. Encourage her to seek professional help. She probably feels overwhelmed with life's problems at the moment. Her feeling guilty about not spending enough time with you is also contributing to it, please keep that in mind.

It is worth bearing in mind that this is very early in the relationship. If he did message anyone after you got together, it may have been a crossover period while he was settling with you. He may not have known how serious the relationship is. Of course, he could also be a scumbag. I don't know the bloke, none of us do, only you do. 

Take a deep breath, and and don't make rash decisions. Relationships are founded on trust, and that works both ways. Speculation and jumping to conclusions will get you no where. He says he's not messaging other girls. Do you have enough information to decide otherwise?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#Effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#Effectiveness)

""Although there is some debate in the [scientific community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community)  regarding the efficacy of polygraphs, assessments of polygraphy by  scientific and government bodies generally suggest that polygraphs are  inaccurate, may be defeated by countermeasures, and are an imperfect or  invalid means of assessing truthfulness.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#cite_note-faspol-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#cite_note-APA2004-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#cite_note-nap.edu-8) Despite claims of 90% validity by polygraph advocates, the [National Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Council_(United_States)) has found no evidence of effectiveness.""

The fact that be believes that polygraphs work AND wants you to take one to ""catch you in a lie"" is so alarming its almost comedic. 

Also, the people who run polygraphs (commercial or otherwise, but especially commercial) want to be as distressing towards you as possible, in the hopes of getting you to admit to whatever they want you to, and in your case, keep people paying to come in by delivering what they want to hear.

He said he needed space and didn’t call me for two weeks. Once he reached out, we attempted to reconcile but he still “knew” that I cheated and stated that there would be “changes” in our relationship (rules? controls?) so I dumped him.

I’ve thought about this A LOT. When I met him he stated that he doesn’t trust people and that he could be paranoid, but that he trusted me. In retrospect, I see that he was a high-functioning alcoholic and addicted to weed.

The truth is that his future is bleak, and uncertain. He, just like almost a million of other people like him feel the same way.

Am pretty sure that inside he wants to succeed in life as we all do but the reality is that due to the current political climate regarding DACA or/and imigration it certainly gets harder to succeed in life due to his immigration status.

The reality is that if he were to finish school and look for a job it wouldnt last long since DACA may be over before than.(next year)

So inside he feels anxious and depressed because he feels like what's the point in working hard if it's gonna be taken away soon and he will be forced to work a job with meager pay. In other words all that work for nothing.

He doesn't have all the luxuries you as a citizen have.  One wrong turn in traffic can cause him to be deported to another country, and he looses everything.

Why don't you go see a dietician who can work out a meal plan which will help you lose weight while being healthy for the baby. Being pregnant does not mean you have to be fat, albeit some woman see it as an opportunity to eat whatever they want.

I know you’re attracted to what you’re attracted too but as someone else said, it’s not like you gained drastic weight.

I only brought up the not talking about it thing because I wasn’t sure if it was bothering him? I talk about my gain often with my fiancé because I feel disgusted in myself and I worry he could be despite him saying otherwise. My ex was similar to your husband. If I even gained 10lbs (which is normal fluctuation to me), he didn’t want to have sex or cuddle. Nothing. I developed such a body image problem dating him I would literally starve myself. I weighed 113 at one point, my ribs were showing, and he still wasn’t attracted. I started to realize the number on the scale wasn’t what it was. 

His next gf weighed more than I did during our relationship. Not that I judge, I think all woman are beautiful! It was just what I observed and it helped me realize it wasn’t my weight with him. It was other things. My fiancé still tries to come on to me regularly. 

I mention that, because maybe you guys should try counseling? Try to figure out if it really is a physical attraction thing or is it something else. Again, I know people are attracted to what they are attracted too but I’m hurting for you. You shouldn’t ever walk around hating how you look just because of what someone else says. I don’t know what he says about it, I can only hope it isn’t anything rude, but I know it still has to hurt. 

As you get older it’s only harder to lose weight and some people reach a certain weight and stop. What happens if after you have the baby you are at a certain weight and despite best efforts, you can’t lose it? Do you guys just not have sex? :( 

I’m sorry if I’m not being helpful. I’m sure you are beautiful, baby growing or no baby. I hope he’s able to be attracted to your new body or you guys can work this out.

3417,f9pnf0u,e6e8tx,tiliquas,1575543332.0,18,"You dont have to overthink your feelings so much. Its rare to find someone you have a special connection with, so cherish it rather than having regrets later. Most crushes are passing fantasies, whether same gender or not. Acting on them is what makes them a relationship. You seem a bit stressed specifically of the same gender aspect. Theres no reason for this, If your worried that acting on this crush means you have to label yourself a certain way, thats not the case at all. You are allowed to just explore ur feelings normally. So just treat it as any other crush you'd have on a friend.

For what to do with him, Id say hang out as normal and see how your relationship develops. If you dont know if hes LGBT friendly and your sister is openly out then you can try mentioning that and see how he responds. He seems pretty chill and didnt seem annoyed or anything by your first hug but Id wait to see if he is a naturally physically affectionate person so things dont get weird. 

Depending on what kind of person he is, I guess you could also just be upfront with him about your feelings, saying you dont want to jeapordize your friendship and you think you may have feelings but you are okay if he doesnt reciprocate. But be sure that you are in fact okay because unrequited feelings can lead to messy friendships. 

As for the part about only liking him and not every men,  pretty sure everyone regardless of sexuality isnt into every single person of the gender theyre attracted to. We all have a type. Also it can be hard to recognize same gender attraction because the model of relationships we get through media is male/female.

That'd be my only piece of advice and if you think he may be bi or more attracted to men I'd probably discuss your feelings before you make a move on him or anything. If he is straight and you know he's straight, maybe just keep this to yourself if you don't want to damage your friendship.",2019-12-05 15:56:55

Don’t overthink things! I’ve been LGBT my whole life and still don’t have a definitive “label”, I just roll with it. It’s very freeing to do, I’d suggest not trying to find a label right away or anything 

You asked why only him you’re feeling this attraction to when other guys have been a DEFINITE no. Well, that’s just how humans are. He checks the right boxes to get your heart racing, and other guys didn’t. Just like some girls would be a definite no while others are clearly wife material. 

And lastly, if you wanted to pursue something with him, and your sister is openly bi, mention that to him to see how he reacts. I’ve done the exact thing many times and it really is a safe way to find out someone’s stance on LGBT. 

But, if you don’t know if you want to pursue something, just ride the waves my man. Let yourself explore your feelings, there’s no rush.

3454,f9ph43r,e6e3va,hsteve102,1575535727.0,3,"I guess I have a similar experience to you but a very different outcome. 

Me and my partner were each others first relationship, and we would have little arguments about different things and struggled with our differences at first. It felt a lot like I was always keeping the relationship going when he was making no effort and really not trying. I would complain and vent my frustrations at him and he would apologise and say he will change and then nothing would happen. He even once confided in me that he would do/not do things on purpose cause he knew I would get frustrated and that because of this he didn't think he was emotionally mature enough for a relationship. 

Unfortunately, relationships are also about compromise and to be able to grow and change he needed me to do things a certain way as well. For example, we work on a system in our house where if I want something done, simply ask him, or write him a list. Before I would tell him what I needed done and he would nod and then remember one thing to do and instead of asking he would barely do that one thing then not bother and leave me to do everything. Small issue, immensely frustrating. 

So, the thing we realised was that we both loved each other, and that was worth fighting for. However, compromise comes with that and if one person in a relationship either doesn't want to compromise or doesn't think its worth fighting for, then it's a losing battle for the other. 

Honestly, he may have done you a favour by ending things. You dont wanna spend the next 10 years doi g this same thing and realise you've wasted it on someone who isn't worth all the effort you've put in. The best thing might be to let yourself heal, make sure you are healthy and happy most importantly. You can look back on this relationship and remember good times and use it as a learning experience going into other relationships. It was your first, but your young and beautiful and there are plenty of awesome potential partners out there for you, find one that makes you happy.",2019-12-05 08:48:47

You could reflect on who you are and how you treated him. How you could do things differently, things you learned or are learning from your relationship.  You can talk to him about it if he is willing, and try to get some closure for yourself and be mature in parting ways so that neither of you regrets your time together.  

Statistically you will break up with every single one of your partners except maybe one. So view every relationship as an experience to learn and grow with someone, and then when that time ends, you can be mature in moving forward. It still hurts, you invest in that other person, but it's only a wasted investment if you dont carry your experience from your time together and enhanced your capacity to understand your next partner.

For the first part, just explain that is not really your type of humor and that if she wants advice or feedback to make her Tik Toks better that you won't really be able to help because you don't know what's funny in that realm because it's all kind of foreign to you.
Suggest that she ask for that advice from a good friend  instead who might also have that interest and will be able to help her. If I was in that situation that's just how I would frame the conversation, it shows that you do want her to get that help and validation from somebody who can offer it, and hopefully help minimize a purely emotional (hurt feelings) reaction with something logical but caring at the same time. And if she did connect with someone else on it, it will help with that second part..

For the second part, I can't think of much you can do about that...It might be disappointing for her that you don't react the way she hopes, but the sooner she knows it's not your cup of tea the sooner it'll be a nonissue in the future. My husband and I have drastically different senses of humor and that has definitely caused some bumps in the road, but the longer we've been together the more we've developed our own merged sense of humor and been able to have more and more laughs together. All couples have things they disagree on, it's how each person chooses to handle those disagreements that matter, taking into account the importance of the subject disagreed upon. As long as there's respect and patience, you always grow together out of the situation. If she gets disrespectful at all or treats you like you're in the wrong for not having the same sense of humor, or for not suddenly being able to have interest in it for her etc. that's low level gaslighting and shouldn't be tolerated.

My advice would be to speak to your bf and their parents about only the issues that directly affect you - keep it factual and ask for their advice on resolving it. With her being rude to you and about you, don't take the bait. It sounds like jealousy, so either ignore it completely, be nice in response /laugh it off /turn it into a joke or pick your battles [saying eg there's no need to be rude] but don't bite back. If you respond in kind, it'll be satisfying in the moment but things will escalate.

3630,f9pe8n9,e6dqid,poisoned_pizza,1575531723.0,3,"You’re dealing with some crap I kinda dealt with a while back. My husband was convinced his feeling/not feeling during sex was due to being circumcised when he was born... 

And then the whole porn addiction thing occurred too and things became real apparent (look up porn induced erectile dysfunction - some ppl might think it’s not an actual condition but I finally heard a doctor talk about it and validate that it’s a thing not that long ago). And I can’t remember if this all occurred when we were engaged or after we were married but I can say it took counseling and a lot of time to heal for both of us and I can tell you I’m still trying to  recover myself to this day even if he’s gone without and has been “sober” if you will. I still probably have ptsd over all of that. Healing takes time though. 

He also still has some ED/low libido issues sometimes (not always and things have improved a lot to some degree) but there a lot of factors that play into that. Meds, performance anxiety, stress, etc. 

This might be something that is suggested over and over on here but I recommend you guys get some individual counseling and couples therapy too given the past and current state of things and try to work through some of this before you decide to get married if you still want to get married as it is! You don’t want to start a marriage with a dead bedroom, and no, while sex and intimacy is not a everything in a relationship and maybe you guys really love each other etc, it is still a huge huge part of the relationship and I think it’s critically important imo. Don’t leave this on the back burner simmering any longer!

When money is high, yes, go for stuff, sure, but it sounds like he's a great guy and will appreciate whatever you do!!

I tend to give my dad a pass because I know he had a terrible childhood his dad was abusive toward his mother physically, was an alcoholic and a gambler so in addition to abuse they didn't have much money so he dropped out of high school at 15 or 16 to make his own way in life. To this day he doesn't speak to his father and I have zero relationship with my grandfather because well I blame him for the father I have. I should note he is abusive to my mother similar to how you described mostly; rarely we have arguements father; it is not to extent of his childhood as he is more or less a good breadwinner. He only acts out like you described when I unintentionally make him feel inferior or is in a bad mood already, and sometimes for 2-3 days after I don't speak to my father. Then he tends to try to gain my favor by buying me something. That's his MO my advice is to learn your dads in order to manage the situation until you no longer have to depend on him. Then when it's done you decide whether you want a relationship with him in your adulthood.

My dad isn’t even physically imposing and he emotionally abused the shit out of me, my siblings before me, and my mom and gets away with it. Why? Because he’s a controlling, manipulative bastard. If he was mature and compassionate he wouldn’t get his way as often as when he manipulates us. And the sad truth is that my mother would rather kill herself than leave my father, and that was before she had several children with him. The fucked up thing is he actually had a wife and child before this family and he divorced the wife and the son is a homeless bum, so he’d indirectly threaten to ruin me and my mom’s life to try and get me to behave.

Here's my advice that I haven't already seen someone else say: Try to calm down feelings of wanting to hurt him and make him feel bad for what he's done. It's very hard, I know... Sometimes the thing you want the most is to make the people who have hurt you feel what they've done to you, but that's how the cycle of abuse continues. And the thing about it is.. you don't have to do anything to make him suffer or to feel bad because he already does. He wouldn't treat your mother that way if he didn't have anger and hatred towards himself already. And the odds are that if you grow up and get out and make a good life for yourself he will realize if he doesn't already and want to make things right with you. It doesn't always happen but it can.

This man is not right in the head.

My best advice for you is to be there for your mother. Express how you feel about the situation and encourage her to seek help.

Dont let any pain he causes you to stop you. It's absolutely scary. It's absolutely not easy. But the biggest help you can have is physical evidence. If he ever lays a finger on you, use it. Sometimes it's the best edge you can have. Your mom very well may be taking beatings so that you dont have to. And she might be too afraid to seek help herself. But if you get any markings from him, show your trusted adults. See the school nurse or a teacher. Show CPS if they show up. Absolutely DO NOT hide it for fear of the repercussions. Keeping you afraid is what abusers do to manipulate you. Once they're caught, they cant do anything to you.

We met up, and had an amazing first date. What was to be a 2 hour thing; ended up being a 5-6 hour date. I was sold, and thought she was sold too. I come home, sold on the idea that I’ll see her again. But a day or two later, i was blocked. Just like that. I moved on. A few months later, I got a message from this girl. She said she was sorry about ghosting me like that. She found that whatever we talked about/how our phone call and then date went, she just felt insecure that she was not up to the standards that our interactions set.

I would also hedge my bet that OP witnessed domestic abuse between her parents frequently when growing up. As someone who treats clients from a lot of underserved populations who don’t traditionally have access to mental health, I can say this is not unusual, but it doesn’t make it any less upsetting. 

Best suggestion I could offer OP is to use this time while he’s in jail to move to a different residence or seek out a local domestic violence organization who can set her up with such if she does not have the money to outright buy a different place. I would then suggest filing for divorce, and taking extensive time to focus on herself and seeking therapy.",2019-12-05 14:37:26

Of course you feel very lost and alone right now, but please understand that you are not alone and there are organizations that can help you. I don't know where in Texas you are (and obviously Texas is a big place), but here are a few links that might help:

National Domestic Violence Hotline:  [https://www.thehotline.org/](https://www.thehotline.org/) 

Aid to Victims of Domestic Abuse - Texas:  [https://avda-tx.org/](https://avda-tx.org/) 

United Way of Greater Houston list of crisis centers and support orgs:  [http://referral.unitedwayhouston.org/MatchList.aspx?k;;0;;;0;0;Domestic%20Violence%20Support%20Groups;Top100;All](http://referral.unitedwayhouston.org/MatchList.aspx?k;;0;;;0;0;Domestic%20Violence%20Support%20Groups;Top100;All) 

The professionals at a crisis center can give you an informed, outside opinion on your situation and they can help you determine what to do next. Even if you don't think you need emergency housing right now, I still urge you to seek out a crisis center, because they are better equipped to help you assess your needs and determine next steps.

Also, emergency shelter is not the only thing a crisis center can provide. You need social and emotional support to get through this experience, and you are not getting that from your sister. I think you could really benefit from meeting with a support group. A DV shelter or crisis center can put you in touch with counseling and other resources to help you get the social and emotional support you need, in addition to financial, legal, and housing support.

As far as the long-term of your relationship goes: should you divorce him? Should you get a restraining order? Probably so, on both counts. You seem to think that the abuse has just started, but from the way you describe his drinking habits (not just the fact that he drinks, but that he gets ""absolutely trashed"" regularly) and your relationship with him (""things just barely started getting violent""), it sounds like your situation is probably worse than you realize, and it probably has been for a long time. It's very difficult to maintain a sense of scale from inside an abusive relationship, and it will be even harder for you to recognize danger signals because you have a family history of substance abuse. It's very likely that your sense of what is ""normal"" in a relationship has been warped by your experiences. Also--once is more than enough! He kicked you in the face because he didn't like the song you were playing. Do you think you will ever feel safe around this man after that?

You mentioned that he called 911 himself, and turned himself in. Does that make it better? Yes and no. He acknowledges he did something very wrong, and he is facing the consequences of his actions. That is a good first step--for *his* personal growth, and his personal journey to becoming a better person. It does not mean that he deserves a second chance with you. Your first priority should be your own safety. The fact that he has shown remorse *this time* does not mean that you are safe with him.

3847,f9rq7oh,e6d1cn,Sage_of_Gruntled_ADD,1575579762.0,1,"What do you mean by ""***things just barely started getting violent?***""

There is no amount of violence, not even ""barely"", that is acceptable in your relationship.

The state doesn't need you to press charges in order to press charges themselves.  This is a good thing, as it means the state can prosecute violent offenders even when the victims of assault have second thoughts due to familial pressures, or intimidation factors.   The prosecutors may call you as a witness, but they don't even need to do that.

You mention ""my husband was trashed like usual"", which indicates to me that your husband probably has a serious problem with alcohol.   Even if he wasn't really aware of what he did to you because he was trashed, and you don't seem to harbor a tremendous amount of ill will towards him, **he is NOT SAFE for you to be around** until he deals with his issues.  While it's admirable that he had the wherewithal to call the cops on himself, that in itself is not enough to ensure your safety without him getting help.

He's already had bail set, which means he's appeared before a magistrate.   Next is for him to get a court date set.  If he can post bail before the court date, he'll be released until his court date, and if he can't, he'll stay in the clink until then.

Given that it's his first offense, and they decided to charge him with a misdemeanor, he'll likely be able to negotiate a plea where he can get the charges dropped after the successful completion of some kind of intervention plan, if he wants to go that route.   

If you want to help him with this, you could reach out to the public defender's office and ask them about the status of his case.   Their intent should be to keep you safe while obtaining the best outcome for your husband.  Which would be that intervention program mentioned above.  

Do you guys have health insurance that covers substance abuse rehab programs?  If not do you have another way to finance it?  Even if it's state mandated, it's still going to cost something.

Now, on to bailing him out.  If you have the financial wherewithal to bail him out, or get to bond him out through the bail bondsman you contacted earlier, you need to ask some questions.  

* Would you feel safe at home with him when he's out?
* Do you have someone else you could stay with (preferably someone sober), if you don't?

I know the urge to find some magical thinking is strong, but the fact that he called 911 on himself does not excuse what he did. You have to talk to his family first and explain what happened before he has a chance to spin the narrative, and you have to do that for your own protection, because the last thing you need right now is his family coming after you to forgive him.

He punched you in the face. He kicked you in the face. He could have killed you. Both of your parents have extreme substance abuse issues and so do the people around you. This is not the support system you need. If there is any way you can get to a therapist I suggest you do so immediately.

You need to put yourself and your safety first here and I think your best choice is to leave. I have heard a lot of abuse stories that start pretty deep into the relationship, so the fact that he has not hit you for seven years is less meaningful than you think.

You're mad at her because you're jealous. Also, because one woman to another when you told her you didn't know about her, she could have shown you empathy. She lashed out. Just remember, she's not shown you her best side cause she's hurting too. That's probably why you got all the questions about the relationship, cause after you find out someone you are so enmeshed with that you know each other's family and friends, have a life together, it's so hard to walk. He's likely telling her all kinds of lies and she doesn't know which of the two of you to believe, and to her, you're the girl who came along and blew her life up. She probably chokes on your name.

I grew up in the Midwest and have gotten that same (sort) comment form a few guys. One told his parents he wouldn’t break up with me and the other did break up with me because we were getting serious and his parents didn’t ‘believe’ in interracial relationships.

This is a ‘them’ issue and it’s very unlikely his parents will change their minds or that he will chance that they are serious about withdrawing financial support.

This isn't totally uncommon in relationships with age gaps- where the younger party ends up molding themselves (not always intentionally) to fit into the older partner's lifestyle/stage. 

The reason is partly due to the fact that she is JUST now supposed to be discovering herself- who she is, what she really wants to do, what her life goals are. Those are things that change *drastically* in people's twenties because as people gain more experience in life, they find themselves adjusting to the new information. *Most* people in their twenties don't know what they want. You say she dated a lot before you, but the values I had for a good relationship when I was in 18/19 were *drastically* different once I got into the real world and had more real-life experience.

The truth is that you have expectations- normal ones for your age (outside the fact that your age gap is fairly inappropriate) which include settling down and whatnot and you should take a moment to think whether Denise blended so well into your life because that's what she wanted all along, or whether she was using your life/expectations as a guide for her own.  Again, this isn't uncommon. 

So she started dating you and from what you said, adjusted to life with you fairly quickly. But you have to ask yourself, would she have *chosen* to be a (potential) stepmother if you hadn't had a child? That sounds funny because it's not like she went in blind, but the *reality* of being in a relationship with someone much older/with history is different than just thinking about it.

 It reads like the stress of molding herself to be in a relationship with you was just too much- and I've seen this happen in mid-life crises when one person has spent a long time in their discovery phase not being true to themselves (either intentionally or unintentionally). 

Anyways, give her space and time. Do not contact her first or give her a timeline of when you're expecting a response etc etc. Wait for as long as you need and then move on if there's been no contact from her. And in the future, I would strongly suggest you date people closer to your age, simply because it is easier to be with someone who matches you in terms of life experience.",2019-12-05 06:44:13

This relationship is definitely salvageable, but only if you can make it out to be. Try to get a time where you can sit down and talk to him about this. It might help if you prepare yourself for this conversation and treat it almost like having a civil debate. 

Your goal is to put forward that you’re feeling neglected by him, so focus on telling him how and why. 

I say this to almost every single situation I respond to, but it’s very important. When talking, try to never raise your voice or put forth outbursts. Keep the conversation low and civil. This makes him have to listen to you instead of trying to yell over you or point out that you’re coming across and complaining.

How? Why? What are you thinking? And then expecting to get something similar in return? You obviously do Christmas on a scale that leaves me back in the dust. 

That's the thing a wealthy retired or gay couple might do - ""Let's do New York for Christmas this year - stay at the Plaza and go skating in Rockefeller Center!"" Well, you got the ice skating part of that. 

OK, moving on. So, for whatever reason this makes sense financially for you. (Trust fund? Sorry, I'm still trying to understand this.)  Now, how do I say this... most people do not give gifts of this... magnitude for Christmas. This was always going to go out of balance. And since this is your first Christmas together, you had no idea how N approaches gift giving. So, it's understandable that his simple approach was unexpected. 

But here we come to the crux of this extreme example: gifts are, by definition, given with nothing expected in return. (Otherwise it isn't a gift.) They are also not a measure of love, respect and esteem - which is something your response is implying. You don't measure a relationship by the cost or extravagance of the gifts, unless you are a 19th Century courtesan collecting diamonds and chateaus in the country from wealthy lovers.

N's gift wasn't thoughtless and it was designed to please you. (Believe me, I have had worse. I have had gifts that were outright lies - one boyfriend gave me a set of Christmas lights in a brown paper bag claiming that he was behind on his wrapping.) Your problem is one of proportion, and that is on you as much as it is on him. As a matter of fact, it is much more your issue for going so over the top.

Let's scrap the presents and get down to basics. Your relationship isn't about presents and trips. What is it like in the day to day? Are you happy with it? If so, don't let Christmas presents mess up a good thing. Take it in stride and learn from it. By next year, it can just be a funny story.",2019-12-05 06:08:47

I dated my ex for six years and he put in no effort and our dates or gifts, included what HE liked and thought I’d be cool with. Instead of things I was interested in or liked. 

Some gifts from my fiancé was a necklace from moonglow jewelry where it has both of our birthday moon phases because he found out they make a full moon. Knows I love that stuff. And the moons glow!

I’m obsessed with penguins so before we were even dating he hand stitched me a penguin stuffed animal. He legit learned how to do this - as he has no sewing machine. It was all hand done. 

I was sick once and he didn’t know why, he went out and got me a care package with all different meds and my favorite snacks. 

The other week I had talked about wanting Cheesecake Factory cheesecake because we got dinner there and I didn’t like my meal and kept saying I wish I would have just gotten cheesecake for dinner. A couple of days later he went to Walmart for cat treats and came home with a mini Cheesecake Factory slice of cheesecake from there. Because “he knew I wanted that cheesecake so bad”. It was like $4 but it was the effort I loved. I cried. 

It isn’t always about the money. You might have spent 1000 dollars on this trip, but the point is you took note of something he wanted and made it a reality. You didn’t have to spend that amount of money, no, but I see the effort you put into that. He could do a romantic night in with candles and flowers and your favorite movies and snacks and it can show more effort for less money. 

I’m so sorry girl. I know how rough it is. Sure you can talk to him about it and he might even change his ways. I just hated that with my ex. I appreciated him changing stuff if I asked but I love that my fiancé does this stuff without me asking. He does it because HE thought about it first. I was a thought to him.

If he has bipolar there's a chance he's off his meds again or experiencing mania or depression. In those states people act out of character and can destroy their own lives without meaning to. He is probably not even aware of his actions and he could be in this cycle for days or weeks or months before his mood switches back to normal. 

If he's in one of these states or not you could have pissed him off with what you said. Maybe he's really devastated about the person he lost and sensitive and hearing it's their loss triggered him. Maybe it triggered someone else with access to his account and they did it. Who knows. 

The only thing you can do now is choose how you will react and handle the situation. I'd start by not getting emotionally connected again since he's twice hurt you.

I believe another poster that said we don't know your full story - - if you're some good looking kid, someone with a potentially bright future, etc. 


You BOTH went into this being a casual thing.
Now she says she's falling in love with you.
She's freaking out, not wanting to be alone, and wishing to LASSO you into a commitment (read: GUILT).

ANY relationship or conversation with the motivation of Fear, Obligation or Guilt is emotional manipulation (there's a book about it, called Emotional Blackmail), and I hope you can be mindful of this... Don't forget that she has this age difference on you, and while those years are years of experience that you don't have just yet, they are (unfortunately) what she's using to influence you. 

 If she says, ""hey, I want the kid, you can be in its life or not, just do support bc this wasn't in your plan and we can revisit getting to know them later on"" - that's one thing, but she's trying to manipulate you into turning this into a PACKAGE DEAL. It's not.

Ultimately, hate to say it, but you are not tied to her. You will yes, have to do right by the kid, but no, you don't have to stay WITH her.

I strongly encourage you to enlist the support of your family and any trusted aunts, uncles, etc. The support will be beneficial to you, and spreading it out (""one step at a time"") will help.

I also concur to get a paternity test. I'd also check into your local benefits (food stamps, etc.) and options for the future for her. 

I don't know her, and I hope I'm wrong, but she strikes me as someone that will continually raise the bar, never be satisfied, and continue to do her best to keep you hooked indefinitely, then, use the kid as pawn when three years from now a healthy relationship you're in deepens and she's jealous.

Hope this helps.

4098,f9p9ayp,e6c8r1,nachosaregood562,1575525986.0,3,"Fuck dating apps here’s what I do. 

I’m a pretty fat NOT so good looking 24 year old Mexican dude but I would say that I can get a women’s number and at a minimum a kiss on the cheek if not make out with them 90% of the time I try as long as they are single or not married  (and if I’m really lucky that night even get laid). 

First step is to be confident in yourself and not be afraid of rejection. The worst that can happen is they say no. If they reject don’t keep insisting. Be confident but not cocky and don’t be rude. When people are out at a bar or club they are trying to have fun so as long as you are having fun and showing the person you’re interested in a good time they will want to spend time with you. 

Second step is the way you dress/appearance and hygiene. I like to keep my hair short and get a low fade and since I’m on the heavy side (6 ft 260lbs) a full beard really compliments my face so I keep it nice and clean. Do whatever works best for you. Obviously make sure you shower, brush your teeth, and I always like to put on a tad bit of cologne. Always have gum or mints. Although you may have great dental hygiene once you start drinking your mouth can get a funky odor and that’s always a turn off for anyone. Also have a pack of cigarettes even if you don’t smoke. You can strike up a lot of good conversations with other smokers which are plentiful at bars. I use slacks and long sleeve button ups for work so I usually wear that to a bar and although it might not look the best on me because of my size I will usually wear a peacoat and leave it unbuttoned and that actually makes me look average and not so fat and overall “refines” my appearance if you will. Coats  seems to work wonders for bigger dudes. And never tuck in your shirt without a belt. Wear dress shoes and they should preferably be the same color as your belt. Nice wrist watches with leather straps also compliment this style and I think it’s more respectful to use your watch to keep track of time than pulling out your phone constantly, that way all your attention is on the person you are pursuing and you don’t come off as disrespectful by always being on your phone. 

I prefer bars over clubs since they are quieter and you can have a conversation as opposed to really loud music in a club. I actually like to go by myself but going with a small group of friends works just as well. I usually go right up to the bar counter and take a seat somewhere where I have a full view of the bar. I scope it out for a while see who’s available and who’s not, who made eye contact with me, or check group sizes as well. Sometimes if it’s only you and a group of 3-4 girls it won’t work since you are out numbered and it’s pretty difficult to keep more than 2 people entertained and engaged at once. 

Once I have found someone I think would be interested in talking to me and I’m interested in I will ask the bartender what they are drinking and to put their next drink on my tab. This has been key for me. I don’t approach them and ask them if I can buy them a drink I tell the bartender to let them know that their next drink is on me. That way the interaction is between them and the bartender who they feel more safe and comfortable interacting with than some random ass dude approaching them. Another good thing is to become a local at several bars in your area so that you build a rapport with the bartenders. If you have a good relationship with the bartenders and know them by name people in the bar notice and this helps them feel safer around you knowing that you’re not a complete stranger and the bartenders sometimes even vouch for  you. 

Once this happens most of the time they get their drink and they come to me and strike up conversation (if they don’t I will usually approach them after a few minutes). Sometimes one drink it’s all it takes other times I’ll buy a few more (I’d rather spend money on drinks for a woman who I can talk to in person than to spend money on a dating site as others have suggested). I do some talking but mostly I ask them a ton of questions and people love to talk about themselves so there’s always something to talk about. Sometimes I’ll do stupid little guessing games where I try to guess birthday’s (I usually ask them to tell me the month and I’ll try to guess the day. If you’re lucky enough and guess it right panty dropper for sure) or do some dumb napkin magic tricks (google it and you will see what I’m talking about) as an icebreaker. Or you can say you’re a palm reader and can tell them their future but once you start just be straight up and say oh sorry I’m not really a palm reader I was just using this as an excuse to hold your hand. It’s okay to be cheesy but don’t come off as clingy, needy, or desperate. 

As the night progresses I usually ask for their Snapchat or Instagram as this is less formal than straight up asking for their number. Night keeps progressing and depending on the vibe I’m getting I’ll ask for a kiss on the cheek but I make sure they reciprocate and i don’t do it myself I always let me kiss me on the cheek that way I know if they are into me or not. Night keeps progressing then I get their actual number and then that’s it the end game is to get the number so you have future contact with them and possibly set up dates. 

From this point on after you have their number it all depends on how far you wanna take it, you already have their number and can continue talking to them in future so whatever more you want to pursue that night form that person is on you. 

You might be thinking well this isn’t gunna work for me cuz I don’t drink. Just order water/sodas for yourself but don’t take advantage of a drunk woman. It is very obvious when someone is drunk and too impaired to make their own decisions vs being lightly tipsy and having a cool buzz.

I really want to emphasize this. The main thing is confidence!! I used to be super shy and would have never imaged I would be able to get with the women I get now. I didn’t even have the courage to go up and talk to someone because I was so afraid of rejection and embarrassment but like I said before the worst that can happen is they say no. 

Well now you know my secrets I still have some refining to do but I pretty much had to come up with this “game plan” for myself since I was always so sacred and introverted. Damn just writing this is making me want to go out right now! Fuck it I think I am

A strong relationship consists of trust and communication. If you can’t do neither, how the hell are you gonna fix it?

After saying everything you need to say you have to rely upon their word that they will work on the problems and try hard to fix them. 

Now, the hardest part is the effort and willingness of the actions to fix problems. 

Once one or the other don’t fix anything, the trust is broken and the communication becomes misunderstandings and arguments.

Sure they are, but you’re already tolerating things your partner does and have already chosen to accept them for who they are.  Your relationship won’t be defined by the experiences of others if you won’t let it.  Marriage can be difficult, but it also an amazing adventure.  My wife and I have been married just shy of 15 years and have definitely had our down times, but we’ve also had far more amazing memories because of BOTH of our willingness to work through the difficulties.   We have 5 children who they themselves have not caused issues, but have indirectly led to disagreements.  Money, intimacy and household chores are often points of contention, and it isn’t uncommon for them to to overlap.  At times money for us gets tight, but we plan, are frugal, and we always keep the lights on, have all of our bills paid, and have some acorns squirreled away for when we need them.  We work as a team.  When our children were younger, intimacy was an issue at times, because I couldn’t understand why she was too tired and seemingly had no desire.  We calmly talked it out, I helped more, and voila....more sexy time.  But we worked together. 

You WILL have disagreements.  Talk about them rationally, have an open mind.  The two of you will have YOUR marriage and your relationship will be different than mine, or anyone else’s who is giving you input.  Do what you can, mean what you say when you speak your vows, remember you’re a team.

I give you all these things, I do all these things for you...!"", and it feels very frustrating and painfully invalidating. I'm sorry she made your illness about her perception of herself as a mother. 

If she's refusing to speak to you, my rule of thumb with the silent treatment is only to say, ""Well, I'll be ready to talk when you are,"" and let them have their silence. 

When she is ready to talk to you, what worked for me with my mom was to point out that mental illness is not an attack on her as a mother. (She's likely anxious about the old stereotype of going to therapy to blame your problems on your parents, and you may very well unpack baggage from your parents in therapy, but do not tell her what you talk about in therapy!! I'm just pointing out her anxiety so you might find a way to quell it, if you think that would work and if you feel up to it.) Maybe point out that you knew to go to a doctor and find healthy solutions instead of turning to drugs or alcohol or other self-destructive coping mechanisms because of how she raised you (but don't say this if it's a bald-faced lie; just make her feel like a good mom.)

If you think she'd be open to that kind of reassurance, I hope she receives it graciously and apologizes to you. If she doesn't apologize, I hope you'll have brought her guard down enough that she'd be receptive to hearing how her comments made you feel and that you'd like an apology (which also works with my ""Well what more do you want me to do?"" anxious mother.)",2019-12-05 07:08:15

\#1: don't joke about having an affair on your partner. You are poking at an insecurity that all people have and disregarding serious issues in the name of 'humor'. It's funny until you catch her going through your phone because YOU PUT THE SEED IN HER MIND that you could potentially have an affair. 

\#2: don't pretend you're pregnant. Even doing it to 'test HIS real plans for the future' is a completely asinine (the fact that your mother thinks that is okay is unreal) and manipulative. This is a flag that she is a manipulator. I cannot stress that enough...it starts small but then the tactics get more and more complex. Often women pulling stunts like this is a red-flag that she will try re-productive coercion (get pregnant on purpose to keep you around) or fake a pregnancy when you try to break up with her. 

Most posts that you see on this sub where guys talk about their GF faking being on the pill and getting pregnant starts with ""a few months ago my GF pretended she was pregnant"". And they got mad but got over it....then the next time it's for real.

Neither of you sound mature enough to be in a relationship, let alone to be in one with each other.

The two of you either need to start acting mature enough to be a couple and lay down some hard boundaries; playing 'jokes' on each other like this is not a part of a healthy, adult relationship.

She too thought it was hilarious.

This wasn't funny, it was cruel and mean. She laughed at your pain with her friends, not for money, for fun without a thought to how you would actually feel.  She needs to get her head from her arse and grow up before shes responsible enough to have a relationship, let alone a sexual one. You can't trust little children to always tell the truth or make the right decisions, and that's what this little brat is.

1. **Get untangled.** Get her out of your social media; don't Google her or go to the places she hangs out - you need her 100% out of your physical life. You must maintain this for six months at the very least if not longer, if not forever.
2. **Lean on your friends**. Don't stay in your room and mope. Go out with friends; see a movie; hang out with them and do stuff together. Even when you don't feel like it, let them be your motivation to turn off the TV and sit down in a room with other people - at least a few times a week.
3. **Take care of yourself.** Go on walks. (Got a dog? They are are great motivator to get you out of the house, plus you will always be loved and celebrated when you come home.) Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Go back to the gym, or play sports , or hike - whatever gets you moving and is fun. Don't dig in to the ice cream and desserts or junk food - you can't eat your way out of depression. And avoid abusing alcohol and drugs - again that is trying to cover up the pain.
4. **Expand your horizons.** Learn something new - a hobby, playing an instrument, to program or write. Volunteer to help people who are worse off than you - it will get you out of yourself and give you some perspective. Especially at the holidays - make someone else's Christmas special. Take a trip to see something you have always wanted to see - now that you are single you can do anything you want. Take advantage of that before you are tied down again.

There are two separate issues here - let's not mix them up. There is your boyfriend's sexuality, and then there is whether you want a sexually open or closed relationship. Your boyfriend's sexuality is what it is. Fortunately, he is bisexual (at least as far as he knows), so that's positive - vagina is on the menu. 

The real issue here is the question of monogamy. Do you want a sexually exclusive relationship? Or are you open to something else. It sounds like he may be open, but you are closed. There is nothing wrong with that - with either of those choices, as a matter of fact. The only problem is that I am not sure you are both on the same page. 

If this relationship only works for you if it is closed and monogamous - then that's what you need to talk about. And if that is a deal breaker, then you have to be willing to leave if you can't get that. 

And, if he is young (let's say, under 22), he may still be forming his understanding of his sexuality and what he wants from a relationship. Which is another way of saying he may want something different in a year or two.",2019-12-05 03:50:48

First off: you know you're in a bad situation of your own creation.  Reddit may very well roast you over that, but you're already beating yourself up over that, so I'll leave that part alone.

As for how to approach this, I think it boils down to a few questions for you. First: is her happiness more important to you than yours, and if so, what will make her happier? If she were to leave her fiance for you, would you be able to go forward knowing that she did that? Would you worry she'd do the same to you? (you have a unique history together, so only you can decide how likely that is). What if you two don't work out for whatever reason, and she's left her (almost) marriage for effectively nothing? Can you and she live with that risk? Conversely, can she have a happy marriage with the other guy, with her now knowing that she'll always wonder ""what if?""  Sort out those questions and it'll probably clarify where you need to go.  Either way, I don't think it can go back to her being your friend.

4610,f9p71ft,e6ah2d,EddieRyanDC,1575523751.0,1,"First of all, I have to say that **you are an extraordinary person**. With a very bumpy start in life and many disappointments you have a heart big enough to embrace both your parents and the empathy to see their struggles and the love, however imperfect, that lay behind them.

Let's take the last question first - **how to forgive him.** You can't do this directly, like making a royal pronouncement ""I hereby forgive all transgressions and declare you free of being in my debt"". This isn't one wound - it is a lifetime of being lied to, disappointed, abandoned, bullied, distrusted - well, we can go on and on. This is like peeling back the skin of an onion, only to find a new layer there to deal with.

Maybe a better metaphor is that **this is a road which you have already started down**, and to which you recommit. It is hard work, and you can only take a section of the road at a time, but each day you stay on it you are farther along than you were before. And much farther along than those that never chose to take this route.

So, how do you do it? You take these issues as they come up. You mentioned your 18th birthday. Go someplace where you can walk and think and be alone. **Remember that day** and what you wanted and what it was that hurt you. What were you feeling? What were you angry about? How did that affect you. Pretend your dad is there and tell him what he did and how that made you feel. Just dump it out. If you need to, throw a rock; pick up a stick and hit a tree. When you have had it out, **settle yourself down**. Take four deep cleansing breaths. Again, pretend your dad is there, and tell him ""**Dad, I forgive you for...**"" and name the specific things. Finish by asking God or the Universe or whatever to s**end your Dad good things and a good life**.

**Let's step back - what are you doing?** You are acknowledging that the hurt and emotion of the past is real and it is there. You are doing the opposite of burying it and pretending that it doesn't exist. You are recognizing that your dad caused this - or at least played a large part in it. And you are making the choice to let this specific debt go.

This doesn't let you dad off the hook entirely. He really should apologize. And there may come a time when you need to tell him about that day and how it made you feel. But when and if that time comes, *you will have already drained that event of its power, pain, and ability to hold on to you*. The only thing left would be the actual transaction with your dad, to see if he would like to know that he hurt you once upon a time, and might want to apologize. Sometimes we get the apology we need. Most of the time we don't. *Which is why it is so vital to make the choice to forgive unilaterally, so we are not holding on to the toxins of that event* waiting for someone else to fix us.

This is a process you will need to go through as each painful event comes up. **Face it, acknowledge it, feel it, and let it go.**

Or, have a discussing again explaining how it makes you feel, and it comes down to him not respecting you and ensuring you’re happy, comfortable, and feel secure in the relationship. State that this has happened before, he gave you his word it would stop and it didn’t, so if and when it happens again, you don’t feel like it’s a partnership you can be part of because you respect yourself and not involving yourself in a situation that sets you up for negative feelings.

You say he normally does well with girls, but was he attempting to intimidate their guy friends? Or did they not have close guy friends the way you and S are?

Bottom line is that he sees you as competition now, and it reflects more on him than you. WHY does he think you're competition? Does that mean that if he was in your situation he'd stop being friends with S if YOU asked him to? Does he secretly think that you and S have a more friends with benefits relationship because he doesn't understand that men and women can be actual friends without wanting to by physical?

If he's a cool guy, and an actual friend, you should be able to tell him to cut it out, and that you aren't going to stop hanging out with S or being friends with her, without him going off.

Also, just throwing this out there, do you think that A and S should be dating? Do you think they are a good match and this is just some weirdness that A has got to get over? Or do you think that this is momentary infatuation that A has for S, built up even more as he sees you as a gatekeeper to her forbidden fruit?

4875,f9ppdk9,e69li6,Kitnado,1575545227.0,1,"Depends on their love language. My gf's love language is consideration (e.g. thinking about her in a shop, whether she needs something like shampoo), chores, food, feeling safe, gifts.

Mine is mostly physical contact and feeling loved / feeling affection of another person.  You won't do a lot for me giving gifts, getting me the shampoo I needed, or cooking dinner for me. I'll still appreciate it, but mostly because those are kind things to do, not because I like them especially.

So if her language is about consideration or gifts, get her flowers and/or another present. If her language is about feeling appreciated/loved, write a letter telling her how much you love her and why and have a conversation about it too, telling her how much you appreciated her helping you the past week and how she's a great person for it. Food? Restaurant / cook dinner, or order/buy special foods that are too expensive for regular day to day life or that she's always wanted to try. Physical contact? Massage, focus on more hugs / kissing on her forehead/back of her head during her entire day, touch her sexually and tell her how sexy she is. Chores? Do the entire house or things she hasn't gotten to yet that she is procrastinating about. Comfort? Get her the best pillow she ever had or a great fluffy blanket, or set up a pillow/blanket fort at home and do a movie- and boardgame-night while ordering food. Excitement? Bring her on a surprise date and hype her up for it and do something unique but romantic, like e.g. a dinner-in-the-dark restaurant, or maybe glow-in-the-dark minigolf, her favorite movie in the cinema and bring a blanket, or horse-riding for the first time. Music? Look up tours of all her favorite bands and try to pick up tickets for the both of you. Intellect? Take her to a local poetry night, take her on a museum-tour where she has never been, look up what writers/idols/organizations she looks up to or generally talks about and see if they're doing some kind of reading, speech, or presentation, take her to a surprise pubquiz. If she has multiple strong love languages set up a day where you combine multiple things.

While I do believe the instant click is real, in those scenarios it’s always been a flash in the pan for me personally. After that fizzled out, id realize it wasn’t as deep as I thought it was.",2019-12-05 02:05:58

My personal experience: my first long term relationship took time to build. We dated for for four years, 19-23. It ended for many reasons, the short of which is we weren’t right for each other.

The second was 4.5 years, 27-31. I married them, but we never should have gotten married. It was one of those movie type scenes... I knew the moment they walked through the doors of my then work, that they were special. I fell head over heels deep in love, I thought it would be forever. THAT was the connection all the happy movies rave about. But it was an emotionally abusive relationship, their family was severely messed up and they didn’t know how to set boundaries, there was gaslighting and manipulation, and it ended terribly. I thought I would never love again, but looking back, I did what was best for me and my health, and I did what was right by ending that relationship. I don’t miss it, and I don’t miss them anymore. I felt liberated from chains and ideas I put on myself from the time I was a child. I found my true self, and I love the growth I found through/after that relationship.

My current relationship (started when I was 32, been together just over a year now), that I genuinely feel will last the rest of my life: I thought they were magic. I wasn’t initially romantically attracted, but... spiritually? I knew they would be important to me, but that could have manifested as being best friends for life, I genuinely didn’t have a moment of wanting them for a partner, but rather I knew they were magic and deserved love and respect and happiness, and I wanted to be a part of building that for them. When we became romantically involved it was like breathing air, it came naturally. That’s not to say it came easily, sometimes it’s like breathing while running a marathon lol. But no matter what, I only want love and happiness for them, and I deeply know that they feel the same. So yes, connection was instant, but it was like souls saying hi... it wasn’t a connection like, “I want this person for myself”. If that makes any sense. 

There were a few one year relationships in there, but I wouldn’t consider them long term because it was more like companionship while growing on my path. 

In each relationship I learned about myself, how I wanted to be treated, what I found acceptable (or rather, mostly what I found unacceptable), and how I wanted my love and who I am to be received. My past relationships there was always something that I really didn’t like about them, or something that they really didn’t like about me. In my current relationship, we build each other up and only want to see each other shine, and we work together to build a future that’s beauty for the both of us (with a lot of life’s difficulties in between, it’s not a highlight reel, but the highlight reel sure looks damn good lol).",2019-12-05 05:35:33

Whatever my first instinct is only intensifies in the same direction: if it starts out hot, it goes nuclear; if I feel meh, it turns to ice, no matter how much time/exposure/getting to know them I do. When I’ve tried to give it time, knowing it wasn’t there, it has NOT ended well. 

I’ve been in 7 serious relationships, and because of this screening process, all of those started with a stomach-droppingly intense connection. However, that was just the first-round qualification. 6 of those 7 obviously failed or I’d still be in them. 

I see a lot of people here talking about clicking like an infatuation, locking-eyes-from-across-the room. For me though it is something different. I don’t know how to describe it exactly.  

For ex: I met my current SO 2 years ago at an engagement dinner. I was five years deep with my now ex-SO (who I clicked with too, originally — again, no guarantee) and this guy brought his GF as his date. Didn’t matter. It was instant, mutual, and completely obvious to everyone in how we interacted. I was physically struck by him, chemically intoxicated, pheromones, whatever, but it was also because I could just tell our compatibility was off the charts without having to try to make it so. It was like listening to a song I’d never heard, but somehow knew all the words to. We saw each other maybe 3x in platonic denial over the years, half ignoring each other until I was single, and he finally confirmed what I knew for myself was true for him too. Without it, would we have been as compatible? Maybe. Would we have gotten together to find out? Definitely not. 

I have only ever felt that click feeling with guys I’ve met a) irl, b) doing something else, c) who I could observe interacting with others before we interacted ourselves. There is a pattern there. It’s why I don’t date online or ask out strangers at Starbucks. It isn’t compatible with my partner selection style. For some people it works really well because it gives them time to observe and feel it out. 

If it’s important to you, you aren’t feeling it, and it’s bothering you, it may be worth it to look at:

1. How you interact with others and how you tend to make new friends, as it tends to be somewhat similar to romantic relationship formation (all my friend decisions are made super quick too);

2. What you notice in the people you are attracted to, and what they have in common;

3. Whether you tend to assess things intuitively and making decisions with your gut or by sensing/observing things and “adding it up” one experience at a time — if it’s the latter, you may not “click” until you’ve gathered enough input and would benefit from being patient; if it’s the former, your feelings may not change over time. Learn to UNDERSTAND AND TRUST YOUR PROCESSING STYLE. It doesn’t lie often.",2019-12-05 07:38:02
4899,f9pgbip,e69hjz,Holllens,1575534554.0,2,"Me and my so met through a mutual friend. We were introduced to each other over msn (a messaging media back in the day). That first day we talked through the night. The day after, we talked till 3 in the morning, it was also the first time we saw eachother through Skype (which was new back then). We had made plans to see eachother Friday evening for thea.. she ended up staying for the weekend. (No sex)

I was waiting at a buss stop for her to arrive.  I was nervous, she was nervous and after the buss dropped her off and the usual cermonial greeting (shake hands, 3 kisses on the cheeks) was over, we looked into eachother's eyes and we just clicked. 

It took us 5 seconds to click.
It felt comfortable, easy and safe.
We talked.. talked some more and then talked more.

Week later (still no sex) I dropped on my knee to ask her if she wanted to make it official and become my girlfriend. I had this ring on my necklace and gave it to her as a token of my affection. If it was someone else she would run for the door screaming, but that girl... She was different from the rest.

The two of us, we don't get how people have to work on their marriage.. it goes so easy for us.

We both understand that relationships are about more than just love or desire and we consciously take steps to be life partners in every sense.

There are many women who don’t want a full on boyfriend, just a FWB - that’s what you need to look for. Could be a single mom, divorcée, professional or travels a lot, could be a married woman looking for the same as you.

You can find attractive women 25-50 to date and get to know, it just takes a little time and effort on your part.

5038,f9omc5u,e68yl2,lolliesandstuff,1575508129.0,1,"Hon, I also am 40 years old and I just went through exactly what you’re going through.  I can help you, I understand completely what’s going on here.  

The reason you can’t leave and you think you love him is because you’re experiencing a trauma bond. It’s very hard to leave someone when there’s a trauma bond.  A trauma bond occurs when you have an abuser who continually forces your mind and body into fight or flight mode.  When we’re in fight or flight mode, our body releases these chemicals (dopamine for one), and our bodies and minds become addicted to it.  It makes us even more dependent on our abusers.  Then when we leave our abusers, we experience a complete crash, without this influx of chemicals, the depression, loneliness and the void where our abuser once stood is overwhelming.  Then when our abuser calls or tries to get us back, the rush of fight or flight chemicals come back and the feeling is so amazing that we get back together with the partner.  

If you fight with every piece of your strength to stay away from your abuser and not give in, after about 1-2 months, something lifts off your brain quite suddenly.  It feels as if you’ve had something over your head like a rubber band tethering you to your abuser, and it snaps away so quickly and you see the situation for what it really is.  It happens quite suddenly.  After this point, when your abuser contacts you, all you feel is fear for yourself and relief.  

My abuser had Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), and I’m telling you, yours does too.  They’re all the same.  They are all playing from the same playbook, so it’s easy to spot.  They all move the relationship alarmingly/red flag quickly, they all lock you down with marriage or children, they all become extremely controlling.  Mine also earned a lot of money and convinced me to quit my job (I earned over $100K also) to help him get his house (he called it our house, lol), ready for sale.  The minute I did this, I was lost to him.  I was living in a beautiful 2 million dollar house in the city, and I became this person who was abused and controlled, with no money of my own.  Pretty soon he was denying me basics that he still had, like health insurance, and car insurance.  

He was emotionally, financially, psychologically, sexually and eventually physically abusive.  I have PTSD now but am working through it.  

A lot of the things you say about your partner are the same as the things I can say about mine.  It’s great that everyone thinks he’s this amazing guy isn’t it? 

The things you think about yourself and about him aren’t true.  

Just find the strength to leave this nightmare and stay gone.  Unfortunately, you’re in for a bit of a battle.  You’re going to put a lot of blame on yourself for the situation you ‘let yourself get into’.  I know this sounds strange, but it’s going to happen.  It’s not your fault.  These people show you a reflection of yourself, so you think they’re a great partner, someone amazing that you want to be with.  Just remember, that the good version of him, the charming wonderful person is actually a version of you that he’s adopted to lure you in.  You are amazing, you just got suckered this one time and you’ll never let it happen again.

5039,f9omm57,e68yl2,Up-Town,1575508320.0,1,"40+F, your fiance's abusive and controlling behaviors cannot be excused -- but perhaps they can be explained. They may be due to his having very weak control over his own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you likely should be seeing 4 other warning signs you do not mention here.

The first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, he started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- or started attempting to isolate you away from close friends and family? He would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HIM. And he generally would HATE to be alone by himself.

Second, you would be seeing him rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein he categorizes everyone as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because he also uses B-W thinking when judging HIMSELF, he hates to acknowledge making a mistake.

To him, it would mean he is ""all bad."" He thus would blame nearly all mistakes on you and view himself as ""The Victim."" Always ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""

Third, you would not see him expressing his rages to total strangers (e.g., road rage against strangers). Rather, the outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or his parents).

Fourth, you often would see him flipping, on a dime, between Jekyll (loving you) and Hyde (devaluing or hating you) -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on eggshells. These flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. And a few hours or days later, he could flip back just as quickly. Are you seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of those behaviors?",2019-12-05 01:12:00

When I was dating my ex, he put on around 35lbs after college, with the weight gain came a sedentary life style, drinking, poor diet, and overall a lazy disposition. It wasn’t exactly him I wasn’t attracted to anymore, but his laziness and lack of motivation to do anything physical. He wouldn’t go out much with me anymore because none of his clothes fit him well and he was convinced he would loose the weight quickly when he started working out so he didn’t buy new clothes that fit. We broke up for other reasons unrelated to his weight, but there were some days where it was so hard to watch him squeeze into an old stretched out t shirt to scarf down a whole pizza and pitcher of beer, then lay around all night with a stomach ache instead of go out dancing like we planned. There were definitely days like that I thought about ending it there. 

In my situation, it wasn’t about all his physical appearance (even tho I’ll admit I was less attracted to him physically and physical attraction does carry some importance) but it was more how his new lazier lifestyle differed from my active one and I felt myself unintentionally pulling away. 

I’m not saying that you’re lazy or unmotivated like in my situation, but your lifestyle is probably a lot different now from what it was 30lbs ago. I would talk with him and approach it from that angle.

I'm a 5'7"" guy at 165 lbs with fairly significant amount of muscle and could stand to loose another couple lbs.  BMI puts you at 29.  I had an ex probably right around where you are now and had real issues being sexually attracted to her; it got to the point where I'd drink before getting frisky because I catch a glimpse of the stomach or something during the deed and loose focus.

That being said, extenuating circumstances need to be understood by a partner.  I was with that woman for like 2 years after she got up to that weight; it was a drain on the sexual side of our relationship, and ya I wished she was in better shape, but I didn't demean her or threaten to break up with her over it either (late add: The impact on our sexual relationship was certainly the impetus for our inevitable breakup; we lost a lot of the romance and I was too young/too chicken shit to be straight with her about why I wasn't as into sex as I had been). 

Last note: You say he is focused on his weight too, right?  Is he in good shape? Does he make time for the gym?  I make myself go to the gym daily - even if I have to cut sleep a little short, or delay a plan - because it's vital to me to stay in shape and it greatly helps me with my mental health; the high after a good workout is the best anti-depressant around.  He could be trying to (haphazardly) get you into the gym for that reason.  The other (maybe more likely) reason could be that he sacrifices to put in the effort to look good for you, and sees you having not done that for 2 years now.  This isn't a couple months, you stated this is 2 years.  At that point he has to assume this is just you now and he wants someone that wants to be fit.

He is not shallow. He is just not attracted to overweight women. No amount of guilt or shaming him changes that.

(Oh, and please note that women are not drooling over short, pudgy guys who have great personalities.  Abs and such seem to rate kind of high on the things females seek in their eye candy.  But surely \*that\* is just cultural conditioning, right? And women could easily find flabby, stooped 70 year olds hot, if only the culture let them.  /eyeroll)

Now, if you want to gain 40 pounds as a young person, and expect your SO to just be okay with that, you can certainly pursue that approach to things. However, do not be surprised or resentful when that approach does not lead to a happy SO.  You are not entitled to your SO's sexual attention; it is earned.

One of the ways you earn it is to keep appearance in reasonably good order.  It is right up there with remaining employed, being kind, parenting offspring, taking their wants into consideration, etc.

Yes, people age and sicken, but the inevitable realities of our mortality do not mean your SO has to simply accept whatever you decide to do in regards to your weight.  He gets a choice in the matter, just like you get to decide how much to eat.

Exercise in general does wonders for your mental health, fyi. I can understand what you mean about stuff piling up: I too have worked 48 hours a week while taking 15 credit hours - i did that for two years before I switched to online school to get more time flexibility back. But I couldn't have done that without exercising at all. 

You need to prioritize yourself - 170 lbs at 5'4 is not healthy at all. Tbh, I don't even care about the fiance right now, I just hope you can get healthier.

It’s great you want to lose weight health wise - and maybe it is or isn’t a top  priority at the moment.  Your boyfriend of 10 years clearly finds that weight and physical attraction coincide, and that this is a vital aspect in a relationship for him. And maybe you don’t. 

If you are not adamant on losing the weight at this point, and do not view things the way that he does, then maybe you and him are not compatible. Also, if you are actively attempting to lose the weight (hopefully for yourself before anyone else), and he is not treating you well due to your current weight, I would let him go. You don’t need someone hanging your weight over your head in a negative way, and using it in a threatening way, either. Losing weight can be challenging, and just like many challenges in life, when you have a partner, things are easier and relationships can remain positive when both people are supportive and encouraging of one another.

I will say, he seemed to be critical of your weight even when you were at a healthy weight and had an active lifestyle. Personally. I think you are better off letting him go due to the fact that he seems like he would just add more stress and unhappiness in your life. I believe your confidence and self worth could be affected by his words and opinions. If you lost the weight he still may be critical.

Your weight is going to fluctuate over the course of your lifetime, and many times you won’t be able to control that (stress, pregnancy, if you happen to get injured, the first few years of raising a kid). I can tell you if you plan on having kids, you can’t really decide how much weight you’ll gain while pregnant (you can try, but the body finds a way lol). If you’re like most women, you’ll gain anywhere from 30-50lbs and it takes a lot of time to drop that weight, even if everything goes perfect. That’s not having a c-section, and not getting injured from the pregnancy/birth. And it changes the composition of your body. Women generally get their mostly pre-baby body back like a year after birth, and still things are different. If he’s so fixated on weight, and how your body looks, he’s not going to be the supportive partner you need in that time of your life. You mentioned wanting kids, so that’s why I bring this all up. And with postpartum hormones, you realllllyyyy don’t need that kind of body-shaming/confidence-bashing during that time. 

There’s a saying that goes something like, “just because you invested a lot of time making a mistake, doesn’t mean you need to keep making it.” 

Not that I mean to imply that your relationship is a mistake, I just mean, if the ten year investment were taken out of the picture, is his mentality one that you would hitch yourself to? Is that person someone you want to be your main support though life, through pregnancy, through raising a child/children? Don’t think about how much time you’ve spent together.
