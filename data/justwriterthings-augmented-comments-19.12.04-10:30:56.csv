wrote that my main character's teenage daughter had a friend, who's mom was a business owner, who she sometimes helps out at the business, and always busy and working, so she never has time to go to school things or hang out with her daughter.

Was supposed to just be a quick write off for why her friend was always with her, and adding a quick write off of ""What's his daughter doing on winter break?"" and write off why her friend is always over.

Later had a plot point be that the main character found out the vampires owned a local hotel, and used it to deal a lot of business.

Wrote there was no front desk clerk when they got there at first, originally thinking ""they know who this guy is, they're just trying to slow him down by having him wait while they set something up.

Realized the hotel was local owned, and that the pacing was better if there is no ambush or attempt on his life there.

‚ÄúTwo Charming Uncles Laughing To The Beat‚Äù

Harold Bond was thinking about Zach Chan again. Zach was a kind angel with charming eyes and skinny warts.

Harold walked over to the window and reflected on his backward surroundings. He had always hated creepy Athens with its careful, crowded cliffs. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel calm.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a kind figure of Zach Chan.

Harold gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a loving, hilarious, tea drinker with pointy eyes and ginger warts. His friends saw him as a broken, bumpy bear. Once, he had even helped a cute injured bird cross the road.

But not even a loving person who had once helped a cute injured bird cross the road, was prepared for what Zach had in store today.

The snow flurried like loving frogs, making Harold gay. Harold grabbed a ripped record that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Harold stepped outside and Zach came closer, he could see the homeless glint in his eye.

Zach gazed with the affection of 5789 thoughtful hurt humming birds. He said, in hushed tones, ""I love you and I want a kiss.""

Harold looked back, even more gay and still fingering the ripped record. ""Zach, I admire your eyebrows,"" he replied.

They looked at each other with sleepy feelings, like two sturdy, salty snakes jumping at a very helpful bar mitzvah, which had R & B music playing in the background and two charming uncles laughing to the beat.

Suddenly, Zach lunged forward and tried to punch Harold in the face. Quickly, Harold grabbed the ripped record and brought it down on Zach's skull.

Zach's charming eyes trembled and his skinny warts wobbled. He looked happy, his emotions raw like a pongy, purring piano.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Zach Chan was dead.

Harold Bond went back inside and made himself a nice cup of tea.

An important part of being a writer is finishing stuff. And one of the most important parts of finishing something, is calling it done and moving on even when you know it could be better somehow.

So they where big glasses with red lenses, since the red light coming through doesn't affect them as much.

My friend didn't pick up on either, despite parts of each being mentioned, and thought it was my version of ""fantasy author over describes food"", since I usually never failed to mention them less than 3 times in any scene either was happening

A Fantasy Novel
by Writer Mcwriter
In a house there lived a magic, moist gnome named Guy Mcguy. Not a noisy moist, breezy house, filled with dice and a backward smell, nor yet a cosy, vast, fluffy house with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a gnome-house, and that means shelter.

One day, after a troubling visit from the zombie Girl Mcgirl, Guy leaves his house and sets out in search of three evil sausages. A quest undertaken in the company of girls, giants and skinny people.

In the search for the zombie-guarded sausages, Guy Mcguy surprises even himself with his resourcefulness and skill as a housekeeper.

During his travels, Guy rescues a blade, an heirloom belonging to Girl. But when Girl refuses to try skipping, their friendship is over.

However, Girl is wounded at the Battle of Four Armies and the two reconcile just before Guy engages in some serious skipping.

Guy accepts one of the three evil sausages and returns home to his house a very wealthy gnome.",2019-07-06 12:27:18

During a wake in San Diego in 1990, a baby is born and dies before she can take her first breath.

During a wake in San Diego in 1990, the same baby is born and lives to tell the tale. That baby becomes 29-year-old Suki Butterscotch, a considerate and noble private detective.

What if there were second chances? Third chances? Fourth chances? Would you eventually be able to save the world from stingy aliens who stab each other? Would you even want to?

*Suki Butterscotch* follows Suki Butterscotch and her cute sister, Sally Doop, as their wild lives tumble through turbulent events in Sleepford, again and again.

However, the end of the world approaches, and time is running out for Suki. She is left with two options: stop the stingy aliens in one hour, or allow the world to end in a ball of fire.

In reiterating your description you may break the illusion the reader had, and that is not a good thing. It breaks immersion. It makes them think critically about the book, rather than losing themselves in it. I suppose if you're not writing fiction this is fine, but if you fancy yourself a teller of fictitious tales, perhaps it'd be best to leave to the imagination as much as possible.

It is better to describe the way other things (light, water, people) *react* to your character's physical traits. MC is out at night? Describe the way the moonlight turns their dirty-blond hair golden. Oh, MC is swimming in water? Perhaps, then, the ripples crash into your character's chest like waves at a rock face.

In the morning, I would look at the book and find incomprehensible nonsense. I don't mean that the ideas are bad but there was no idea communicated.

You might be able to use the wording elsewhere in another story (which is an excellent source of ideas,BTW).

You should only keep things that are absolutely essential to having your story make sense.  Cause/effect, cause/effect, etc.  A story is a series of caused and effects tied together with a common overall thread to resolve a single large problem.

That is not to say there aren't little problems to solve along the way.  There are, but all of them are still tired to resolving the bigger issue.
