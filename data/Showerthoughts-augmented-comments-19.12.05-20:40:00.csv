A male and female bring different skill sets to a relationship and if they are properly matched can allow you to be financially successful, emotionally fulfilled, and can push each other to achieve greater things in life than they would have otherwise done.  Children can bring untold joy and make you a far more understanding and empathetic person as well. But if you choose your mate poorly, then your life will potentially be miserable and unfulfilling.  

Some people are just not cut out to be married or have children, and that is fine. Just avoid having children outside of marriage because it is one of the best ways to ensure you and your children live in poverty and suffer needlessly for generations. Raising children is not a task to be taken lightly.  They need every bit of attention you can give if you want to raise them correctly and even two-parent households struggle with that.  

Every generation tries to re-make societal norms in their own image.  It has been going on since mankind evolved.  It is our nature to challenge existing doctrines and try to improve upon them.",2019-12-05 22:56:25

Calling dibs is something you do on something that previously exists, not something you made. Copyright protects things you make. There's no need to ""call dibs""; if you made it, you \_automatically have\_ the copyrights. Plaintiffs' copyright lawyers are simply arguing that someone else isn't respecting those rights.

Defense copyright lawyers are arguing either that you don't/can't have the right you claim, or that their client is exercising \_their\_ rights (i.e. it's a fair use).

Neither side is really doing anything that could reasonably be considered ""calling dibs"".  Now \_patent\_ attorneys...",2019-12-05 18:57:32
