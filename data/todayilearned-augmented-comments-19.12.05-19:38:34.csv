Lovitz has had an ongoing dispute with former NewsRadio costar Andy Dick concerning the death of their mutual friend Phil Hartman. According to Lovitz, Dick had given Hartman's wife Brynn cocaine at a Christmas party at Hartman's house in 1997; Brynn, a recovering addict, fell back into drug use, culminating in her killing Hartman and herself on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of NewsRadio as Hartman's replacement, he and Dick got into an argument in which Lovitz reportedly said ""I wouldn't be here if you hadn't given Brynn coke in the first place."" Lovitz reportedly later apologized to Dick for the remark.[8]

In early 2007, Dick approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said ""I put the Phil Hartman hex on you — you're the next to die.""[9] On July 10, 2007, Lovitz got into a physical confrontation with Dick at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. **Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartman's death.

Part of the reason people disbelieved her was because she was so unemotional. She did not react as they expected/perceived a mother should act. 

A similar situation was with Claus von Bulow, who was accused of killing his wife, the wealthy socialite, Sunny von Bulow. In the movie, *Reversal of Fortune,* he is played by Jeremy Irons, who won an Oscar for the role.  Alan Dershowitz, the famous Harvard lawyer, when he takes on the appeal case, says to him, something like, “At least, everybody hates you.” And von Bulow responds, “ Well, it’s a start.” - and I took that to mean that they - the media, society etc - were prejudiced against him, so the defense was going to use that in their favor.

During the alleged ensuing engagement, Fürbringer claimed he had seen the skull of an 18-year old member of his crew being split open by a lump of coal hurled by a Royal Navy sailor. When Fürbringer attempted to help a wounded officer to swim, he was told, ""Let me die in peace. The swine are going to murder us anyhow."" The shooting only ceased when the convoy the Garry had been escorting, which contained many neutral-flagged ships, arrived on the scene. Fürbringer later recalled, ""As if by magic the British now let down some life boats into the water.""

>Geoffrey Brooks, who translated Kapitänleutnant Fürbringer's memoirs into English, later commented, ""Regarding the alleged atrocity committed against survivors of UB-110, the normal procedure would have been to report the matter to the German military legal authorities at the earliest opportunity. Depositions would then have been taken from all available witnesses. One can imagine how far it would have proceeded subsequently. It is not, and never has been, the practice of the British military authorities to try British service personnel for alleged war crimes committed against enemy belligerents in wartime no matter how strong the evidence.""

>Lightoller does not go into detail of the incident in his memoir, but he does confirm that he 'refused to accept the hands up air' business. ""In fact it was simply amazing that they should have had the infernal audacity to offer to surrender, in view of their ferocious and pitiless attacks on our merchant ships. Destroyer versus Destroyer, as in the Dover Patrol, was fair game and no favour. One could meet them and take them on as a decent antagonist. But towards the submarine men, one felt an utter disgust and loathing; they were nothing but an abomination, polluting the clean sea.""

He had entrusted the speedy performance of this work to Alypius of Antioch, who had once been vice-prefect of Britain. 3 But, though this Alypius pushed the work on with vigour, aided by the governor of the province, terrifying balls of flame kept bursting forth near the foundations of the temple, and made the place inaccessible to the workmen, some of whom were burned to death; and since in this way the element persistently repelled them, the enterprise halted.",2019-12-05 16:18:26

I know that’s hard to believe and of course it’s perfectly possible that those saying this was done to create some sort of cheap “cannon fodder” could be true as I have no way of knowing their actual motivations. But the reason I doubt the sinister nature is this: during my time serving I unfortunately had to recommend a number of sailors for administrative separation due to developmental and learning disabilities. These sailors often had accompanying intellectual functioning well below average and despite the significant difficulties they had in being able to fulfill their duties they presented a strong desire to serve their country. They didn’t want to be separated and both enlisted leadership and officers in their chain of command would often want to see them succeed and to be retained. Many leaders believe it’s just a matter of trying harder and following orders, and some of the complications that can occur from low IQ are not always easily identifiable as what we know as IQ actually covers a broad range of abilities typically including verbal and perceptual abilities as well as processing speed and working memory. So someone that presents with average or above average verbal ability may appear smart at first glance, but actually have deficits in another area such as perceptual ability that lead to frequent threats to the mission. Many of these people probably never should have been recruited in the first place, but with pressure on recruiters to get bodies in coupled with that previously mentioned desire to see people succeed and grow a lot of people that just aren’t great fits for the military are given that opportunity to serve. God bless them for trying, and for their service, and for all the leaders that work to help those people do the best they can.

841,f9q6ce0,e6gscs,Synaptic_Impulse,1575555950.0,1935,"Interestingly, there's another element that was well on it's way to only being discovered in stars in the same way as helium, namely: 

Technetium (Element #43). 

--------------------------------

Supposedly there is such little naturally occurring Technetium on Earth, that the chances of finding it are effectively near zero. 

It would take some seriously sophisticated lab analysis to find it, that wasn't possible in the 1800's and early 1900's. Even today's labs would have a tough time finding it. (The best chance to find it is within uranium samples.)

Which is odd... 

Given that it's element #43, and not one of those strange high numbered exotic ""artificial"" elements, and it's right there in the middle of the shiny-silvery-metal groups on the periodic table... 

You would think it would be possible to find some naturally occurring  lumps of it on Earth, but no. It just isn't there in any observable form of metal/rock lumps. 

--------------------------------

NEXT... given that it has a close to zero presence rate on Earth, you would then be inclined to think that it would have been most likely first discovered/observed existing only in stars, the same way helium was. 

But no, you would be wrong again! 

Essentially, it was first discovered/observed in the early era of cyclotrons (particle accelerators), when a reflective sheet of foil was analyzed after many particle collisions. 

There on the foil, were the first observed atoms of Technetium, created artificially by smashing particles together. 

So ya, otherwise, if no one had ever observed it in the residue of particle accelerators, then the only other place we would have been able to view/observe it would be in stars themselves (the same way helium was first observed).",2019-12-05 14:25:50
842,f9q2s0w,e6gscs,unnaturalorder,1575554109.0,3415,">Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer. 

>The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.

What qualifies as ""good"" changes, but usually involves some sort of higher deity being on our side (""God is with us""), ideas of moral superiority (""making the world safe for democracy""), and just a general sense that we are actual humans who love our mothers and want what's best while the other guys hate everything we stand for, casually torture and kill for fun, will gladly rape our mothers and daughters, and have alien ideas of morality. In fiction, even when the good guys are defeated, it's only temporary and they'll still fight from the  bottom and topple the bad guys— the good guys *have* to win, after all, so as long as we're the good guys, we're always going to win, and you know we're the good guys because we *don't* do things in cold blood or for the sake of doing evil.

The Nazis certainly didn't see themselves as evil. If anything, they had a messianic ideas about their fate in world history; the Jews were the demonic destroyers of nations introducing degeneracy and the collapse of the world order, so therefore the Holocaust wasn't genocide; it was self-defense, shooting back in a war. Basically, to the Nazis, Greedo the Jew shot first; Hans shot in self defense.

3. Here is an excerpt from the article titled ""Oil Fires in Iraq: In recent years, oil fires have cast a dark pall over northern Iraq's arid landscape."" -- https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/88666/oil-fires-in-iraq -- published on 2 September 2016 by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), United States of America: 


    "". . . Ronald Ferek of the U.S. Office of Naval Research saw those fires firsthand in June 1991. “We flew across whole plumes and did a cross-section, calculating how many barrels had to be burning,” he said. His team used LIDAR to quantify carbon flux and deduce the carbon dioxide emitted. The fires consumed roughly 4.6 million barrels of oil a day, according to their estimates.

    At the time, some scientists warned of dire effects, including a “nuclear winter” cooling effect at Earth’s surface. Some airborne smoke particles can reflect sunlight, driving down temperatures on the ground. Following the theory, particles in the oil smoke would rise into the stratosphere and stay aloft for weeks or months over the Northern Hemisphere.

    But most of the fires in Kuwait did not spill over and burn in pools standing on the ground, as predicted. Instead, they caught fire in the air, Ferek said, when oil shot out of the ground at high pressures.

    “At 15,000 PSI (pounds per square inch), oil comes out like an aerosol spray can rather than a garden hose,” he said. As result, the flames were bathed in oxygen and burned more cleanly than earlier research had indicated they would.

    Like the current fires in Iraq, many of Kuwait’s fires produced thick, dark smoke. The plume color is dependent on the type of fuel burning. Factors like humidity, wind, and fuel density also affect the smoke’s color, said Ralph Kahn, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Kuwait’s natural gas fires, many of which burned alongside oil fires, produced grayish white smoke palls, due in part to the high salt content from the briny substrate there. . . .""",2019-12-05 10:08:20

>The Alaska Milepost warns travelers: “CAUTION: Do not go out on the mud flats at low tide. The incoming tide creates a quicksand effect and is very dangerous.” When the tide is low, the mud is solid enough to walk on. Once the water starts coming up, it turns soft and it is easy to get stuck. But when the mud closes in and the water rises, it solidifies again, acting like cement that has set.
>
>The Dickisons tried to cross a tidal slough that meanders through the flats and, according to accounts by the rescue crews, the four-wheeler became stuck in the mud. Adeana Dickison apparently began pushing from behind, straining to move the vehicle and in the process worked her leg into the muck.

>He took a piece of hose from the mining equipment and gave it to her, hoping she would use it to breathe as the water climbed over her head. “By that time it was over her head - she was breathing through the tube.

>
>By the time backup emergency crews, including divers, arrived from Anchorage, Dickison had been under water an hour. The spot where people had frantically worked to save her was a flat expanse of water, stretching across Turnagain Arm to Twentymile River.

1227,f9px99y,e6akx8,jonrosling,1575550933.0,105,"Some interesting facts about Lincoln Cathedral:

1. The original Cathedral was begun between 1072 and 1088 and completed in 1092. It was built on the express order of William the Conqueror. The cathedral library holds (and displays) the original order signed by the Conqueror with a cross.

2. The Catherdral's founder and first bishop was Remegius de Fecamp, who came to England as part of the invading forces of William the Conqueror in 1066.

3. A fire destroyed large parts of Remegius' Cathedral it in 1141 and the pink calcination caused on the stonework can still be seen in the older parts of the building, particularly the 11th century stairways.

4. It was rebuilt  but an earthquake destroyed it in 1181. It was rebuilt again in 1192 but collapsed again in 1237. It was rebuilt a third time in 1255 and finished in 1311.

5. The tallest spire, on the Crossing Tower, collapsed in 1548 during a storm and was never replaced. Although no longer the tallest building in the world, a line drawn roughly eastwards from the roof of the Crossing Tower at Lincoln Cathedral would not hit any other man-made or natural structures until it reached the Ural Mountains.

6. The Cathedral owns one of the four surviving copies of Magna Carta. It is housed and displayed in Lincoln Castle along with a copy of the Charter of the Forests.

7. The Cathedral is the burial place of a ""blood libel saint"", a phrase generally used to describe children who's deaths were believed to be Jewish sacrifices. Little Hugh was a 9 year old boy who disappeared and was later found dead in a well at a time of heightened anti-Semitism in England. It was claimed Jews imprisoned, tortured and crucified Little Hugh but failed to bury him. One Jewish man was tortured into confession and then executed on the direct orders of the King, Henry III, and another 90 Jews were sent to the Tower of London. 18 were immediately hanged for refusing to participate in the trial. Henry III received their property as a result. The other 71 were tried and found guilty of ritual murder but were later freed under protestations from Dominican and Franciscan friars. The Cathedral raised a shrine to Hugh, which attracted many pilgrims over the years although it was destroyed during the Reformation. During the Cathedral restoration of 1790 a stone coffin, 3 feet 3 inches long, was found containing the skeleton of a boy.

8. Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I, died in Lincolnshire while on progress through the country. Her heart and viscera are buried in a large monument at the east end of the Cathedral. On his  journey back to London Edward I erected a shrine to her and each and every stop. These Eleanor Crosses have mostly been lost to time but a handful remain; and a number of places retain their names e.g. Charring Cross, Kings Cross.

9. The Cathedral holds a Tournai font carved sometime in the 12th and 13th century.

10. The library holds and displays a 15th century child's school book in which the child has scribed the name ""Robyn Hod"" and some words of a ballad. This is one of the earliest written occurrences of the name in English literature.

Not a fact, but an opinion - Lincoln Cathedral is THE finest Gothic cathedral building in Europe. If you're visiting England at any point and have an interest in this ~~is~~land's long history I would really strongly recommend you visit Lincoln, it's Cathedral and it's castle. It really is an absolute marvel of time, place and history.

Green tea has almost as much caffeine as black tea, but it has a ton of Theanine, which counteracts some of the effects of the caffeine.  This is why people report green tea to be calming. 

Green tea also has oxalic acid, which is a bad thing if you are prone to Calcium Oxalate kidney stones.  However, it also has a compound that changes the way calcium and oxalic acid bond, reducing the formation of large stones.  This is why green tea has ben shown to reduce the frequency of CaOx stones, despite containing a decent amount of ocalic acid.

We would routinely see bald eagles, roseate spoonbills, ospreys, and alligators along the far shore of the creek down the hill from our school (there was a high fence, so the gators couldn't get in). Coral snakes were so common that we all had to learn how to identify them and distinguish them from the relatively harmless king snake (""red and yellow, kill a fellow; red and black, friend of Jack"").  We'd routinely catch rhinoceros beetles, NOT catch velvet ants, and shout with surprise when a very slow-moving walking stick would creep up on us along the school wall.

I remember hearing about monkeys back then, but it's so hard to separate fact and memory from childhood legend making.  We thought there was an alligator under a pre-K portable, for goodness sake.  OK, maybe that one was plausible.  In any case, kids who lived along the Cross Bayou told us about a few islands in the middle of the waterway that had small monkeys.  They'd even claim they'd seen them while out on canoes or kayaks.  It was probably nonsense, but who knows?  A few decades later, the Tampa Bay Times reported on at least one ""mystery monkey"" a little farther south near downtown St. Pete, so I guess it could have been true.

I've heard about people disappearing without a trace before, often out in the wilderness with their bones eventually scattered by animals and covered up, or some assumed murder cases where the killer was very careful.

But she wrote letters to her family and friends stating her wish to disappear, packed everything into her car, and her and everything she owned vanished completely without a trace.

The story of Simintov and Levin was the basis for a British play.[7] Simintov deprecated Levin in an interview with British journalist Martin Fletcher. Levin had initially welcomed Simintov but the two fell out permanently when Simintov offered the caretaker help to emigrate to Israel to join the rest of the former Kabul Jewish community. Simintov was adamant he made the suggestion only as he thought Kabul was too cold for the old man, but the older man took umbrage, claiming Simintov was trying to take over the synagogue. A feud ensued, with the Taliban becoming involved after both men reported each other to the authorities for alleged wrongdoings ranging from running a brothel to misappropriating religious objects.[8] After Levin's death, Simintov said he was not sad and would not miss him.

Shaolin Soccer was a Jackie Chow film that did extremely well in HK. I had been a fan of his movies long before. I was looking forward to seeing it.  It finally showed up in my Blockbusters but it was a stupid movie that made no sense. I learned much later that it had been greatly shortened for American release, so parts of the movie that would have made the rest of the movie make sense were cut.

Seediq Bale was a Taiwanese film set in the 1930s that went into nuance about the relations between various ethnic groups in Taiwan as well as having action. When it was released in America the stories had been cut and all that was left was beautiful scenery and an ok action movie.

The peat moss was found to be even more absorbent than the typical cotton packing that was used in the medical setting. It even had a deodorizing power, which as someone who works in an emergency room and has smelled some horrible things, I can tell you is an incredibly important characteristic of wound packing. The absorbent quality of the peat moss is due to the fact that most of the cells in the moss are dead for the purpose of trapping and keeping water for the live moss cells to access in times of drought. These dead cells worked excellently to absorb blood and other bodily fluids. This is a crazy example of using nature to your advantage, especially in the battlefield setting!",2019-12-05 04:38:43

I've done the hour long commute for a few years, and if you've never done it before.... urgh.  

It takes over your whole life.

You're starting your drive when it's still dark much of the year; at the end of the working day you've got at least an hour before you can sit down and unwind. 

Tiny issues become great big things you have to plan out.  If you feel sick at work, you have to ask yourself ""do I go home now even though I'm not that bad - or risk being a hazard to myself and everyone else on the road in a couple of hours' time?"".  Even little things like planning your own diet become a nightmare because the chances are you're barely fit to tie your own shoelaces by the time you get home - eating healthily can rapidly drop down the priority list.  

As for mileage - the car was being serviced twice a year and burning £200 of diesel every month.  It gets to the point where a new car involves a spreadsheet comparing purchase cost and anticipated fuel economy.  I had everything worked out carefully - I financed the car over five years and expected to have driven it into the ground in four.

>>Commuting is for many people a time consuming experience five days a week. The journey from home to work and back is therefore an important aspect of modern life, affecting people’s well-being, and it demands difficult decisions about mobility on the labor and housing market.

>>Commuting is also interesting for economic research conceptually. The decision to commute is hardly regulated. People are expected to freely optimize. This environment allows for testing basic assumptions of the economic approach, like market equilibrium. Positive and normative theories in urban and regional economics, as well as in public economics, rely on a strong notion of equilibrium. It is assumed that people who can move freely and change jobs arbitrage away any utility differentials between people, whether they are due to residential characteristics or due to covering distance, ceteris paribus.

It's interesting to see something about personal satisfaction and happiness put in a formal study and it makes a lot of sense.",2019-12-04 22:36:14

I also suddenly have the time and patience to make my lunch, which generally costs about $4/day, instead of sitting in traffic without pay for almost 2/hrs a day and spending $10+ on food each day downtown (and that’s eating on the cheap in a big city). That’s about $130 a month saved.

The examples he uses, with the exception of Australia, also drive far less than the US due to smaller areas and insane gas prices. This is really just bro-science in some ways.

These people were born in the US to British parents and returned to Britain as young children or had one American parent and were born out of the US. Stuff like that.

So this comment was very tongue-in-cheek. He knew full well about Van Dyke's acting abilities and history.

Hell, after Mary Poppins, Broccoli begged Van Dyke multiple times to star in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang before Van Dyke finally gave in. Albert Broccoli's daughter, who was like 8 years old when Chitty was made, adored the movie so much that she later made it into a stage musical. And now she's a producer on the Bond series.

Also, Broccoli was apparently a tactician when it came to casting decisions. If he really wanted Van Dyke as Bond, he would have prepped for that by first suggesting a few other worse options of non-British actors. This is why the list of ""Actors who almost played James Bond"" is [like 100 names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_actors_considered_for_the_James_Bond_character) and there are probably 100 more that never made that list. Most of them never were realistically considered, they just voluntarily or involuntarily lent their names out for casting leverage.

That's not to say that Van Dyke's name was used to get George Lazenby in the door as Bond, but he might have been used to try to sell the idea on Jeremy Brett (known for Sherlock Holmes). Both are tall skinny dudes, but Brett happens to be British.

“O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!
Sondern laßt uns angenehmere
anstimmen und freudenvollere.

Freude! Freude!

Freude, schöner Götterfunken,
Tochter aus Elysium,
Wir betreten feuertrunken,
Himmlische, dein Heiligthum!
Deine Zauber binden wieder
Was die Mode streng geteilt;
Alle Menschen werden Brüder,
Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.

Wem der große Wurf gelungen,
Eines Freundes Freund zu sein;
Wer ein holdes Weib errungen,
Mische seinen Jubel ein!

Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele
Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!
Und wer’s nie gekonnt, der stehle
Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!

Freude trinken alle Wesen
An den Brüsten der Natur;
Alle Guten, alle Bösen
Folgen ihrer Rosenspur.

Küsse gab sie uns und Reben,
Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod;
Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben,
Und der Cherub steht vor Gott.

Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen
Durch des Himmels prächt’gen Plan,
Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn,
Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.

Seid umschlungen, Millionen!
Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!
Brüder, überm Sternenzelt
muß ein lieber Vater wohnen.
Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such’ ihn überm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muß er wohnen.

Seid umschlungen, Millionen!

The Australians, for example, would have known where the US was pointing their receivers, and would be able to tell right away if things didn't line up with their own systems. A dish in Australia was used during the moon landings while the US was pointing away from the moon.

These numbers are precise without usefully conveying the scale of the calamity. What they mean is that a rock larger than Mount Everest hit planet Earth traveling twenty times faster than a bullet. This is so fast that it would have traversed the distance from the cruising altitude of a 747 to the ground in 0.3 seconds. The asteroid itself was so large that, even at the moment of impact, the top of it might have still towered more than a mile above the cruising altitude of a 747. In its nearly instantaneous descent, it compressed the air below it so violently that it briefly became several times hotter than the surface of the sun.

“The pressure of the atmosphere in front of the asteroid started excavating the crater before it even got there,” Rebolledo said. “Them when the meteorite touched ground zero, it was totally intact. It was so massive that the atmosphere didn’t even make a scratch on it.”

Unlike the typical Hollywood CGI depictions of asteroid impacts, where an extraterrestrial charcoal briquette gently smolders across the sky, in the Yucatan it would have been a pleasant day one second and the world was already over by the next. As the asteroid collided with the earth, in the sky above it where there should have been air, the rock had punched a hole of outer space vacuum in the atmosphere. As the heavens rushed in to close this hole, enormous volumes of earth were expelled into orbit and beyond — all within a second or two of impact.

When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple of days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backward.""

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backward, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""",2019-12-04 14:47:40

> Icelanders have not one, but thirteen Santas, or Yule Lads. These lads are not related to Santa Claus in any way. They are descendants of trolls and were originally used to scare children. In the last century, however, they have become a lot friendlier.

> The number of Yule Lads has varied throughout the centuries but now they are consistently thirteen. The number 13 was first seen in a poem in the 18th century and the names that they carry today was published in Jón Árnason’s folklore collection of 1862. Their current names are: Stekkjastaur (Sheepfold Stick), Giljagaur (Gilly Oaf), Stúfur (Shorty), Þvörusleikir (Spoon-licker), Pottasleikir (Pot-licker), Askasleikir (Bowl-licker), Hurðaskellir (Door-slammer), Skyrgámur (Skyr-glutton), Bjúgnakrækir (Sausage-pilfer), Gluggagægir (Peeper), Gáttaþefur (Sniffer), Ketkrókur (Meat-hook) and Kertasníkir (Candle-begger). As you can tell from these names, the lads are very mischievous and they have retained their unique characteristics to this day. They live in the mountains with their parents, Grýla and Leppalúði. They come to town, one by one, in the days before Christmas. The first one arrives on December 12th and the last one on December 23rd. Formerly, they tried to pilfer their favorite things or play tricks on people (hence their names), but now their main role is to give children small gifts. Every child in Iceland puts their best shoe on their bedroom window sill on December 12th (some try to put their boot, in the hope that they may get more, but so far the Yule Lads haven’t been fooled) and they get a small gift from each lad when he arrives in town.

I watched the second plane hit the tower on TV in the cafeteria, and I remember a girl hysterically shrieking because her father worked in Tower 1. His remains were never found. My english teacher lost her husband, and dozens of my schoolmates lost family members. Once we found out that one of the planes departed from EWR (its literally 15 minutes down North Ave. from our campus) , we were nervous seeing ANY plane taking a path over Kean.

Also, there was an ever-burning flame installed at the Princeton Junction train station installed after the tragedy - and if my memory serves me correctly there were still unclaimed automobiles all over the parking lot close to a year afterwards. It was a sad reminder you learned to look past every time you got off the train.

My first ""real"" post college job was IT support/gopher for a small firm on the floor of the NYSE. Rubble from the towers was still being excavated in 2007. The PATH from Newark to World Trade was routed around the wreckage so you got the see the progress in real time, every morning. I swear to God I don't think I ever heard a person speak during the moments you were riding past. Many people I worked with were still wracked with survivors guilt, one person I worked with was basically drunk or high everyday. He lost his wife as well as many friends, as he used to work in tower 2. I lost touch with a bunch of them after I was laid off following the crash, but found out later that same person took his life in 2011. My heart is aching pulling these memories out.

James Doohan's son played his father's character of Scotty, 

had 'Scotty' working on a prototype Holodeck, 

Grant Imahara of ""Myth Busters"" fame played Sulu, 

they introduced a character of Ship's counselor as an homage to Marina Sirtis on TNG, 

got the original actor who played the alien/god 'Apollo' from TOS to reprise his role for the first episode, 

got John De Lanci (who played 'Q') in TNG to act as a bigoted planetary leader for an episode, 

Lou Ferrigno (the 'Hulk' from the 70's era TV show) acted as a slave trader for a very emotional episode, 

introduced female officers as talented, resourceful, capable members of the crew, especially as an homage to Nichelle Nichols, 

ended the 5 year mission on a high note and blended in the future of Star Trek with new uniforms from Star Trek - The Motion Picture...

This is not a dig at Japanese people just a recognization of the sheer levels of propaganda in their society before and during the war. Many of them were the grand children or children of people who grew up in something close to a feudal society.

I bought far more insurance than I needed and fully planned on killing myself after the two year exemption clause was fulfilled.  My wife didn't know I had this planned, and all I had told her was if anything ever happened there were documents for her in our safe.  That isn't an out of the ordinary thing for me to do as I tend to plan, so she didn't expect anything.  

But for some reason, years later when I was at the lake with my .45 in hand, I simply couldn't pull the trigger.  I wanted to, but at the same time, I knew that me doing so would be the greatest hurt I could ever do to my wife.  Knowing she loved me, even with all of my problems, is what saved my life.  

Today I take medication whether I think I need it or not.  I see a therapist and a psychiatrist.  And while I would love to tell you that life is wonderful and rainbows now shoot out of my ass, that would be a lie.  It's still a rough go many days, but the difference is I focus on what is good, even if it's just how the sun is shining through the trees.  

I guess I said all of this to say I get these people.  I know what it means to just want to check out, but still want to somehow do something good for someone in the process.  The trick though is that ""something good"" isn't that at all.  When my wife found out about my plan she called me a, and I quote, ""fucking idiot"".  As broken as I am most days, for some reason she still likes having me around.  

If any of this sounds relatable to you, maybe there is someone who would rather you be around than have a check from an insurance company.  If not, there's always the sun and the trees.",2019-12-04 21:16:22
2657,f9ne4mx,e5xelg,ZachMartin,1575482644.0,8,"In the United States, almost every life insurance policy contains a 2 year ""contestability-clause"". Suicide is excluded during this 2 year time. Basically any death 2 years post purchase will be an automatic investigation to make sure the insured didn't lie on their application, kill themselves, etc. If they didn't disclose a major health problem or issue that contributed to their death, the insurance company has some protections for themselves, their policy holders (if mutually owned), and/or their stock holders. After 2 years, even if someone kills themselves, the company generally has to pay. There are exceptions to this, but this is 99% of the time. Even though sometimes an insurance company might have the ability to deny claims legally, some companies will ""do the right thing"" and pay the claim anyways, but I would put this is the less frequent category than exercising their contractual right to not pay the claim. While every circumstance is unique, they're not doing this for purely altruistic reasons. The bad optics and PR spin can be more costly than simply paying a claim.",2019-12-04 18:04:04

People often overestimate how superstitious people were in Medieval times, and how oppressive the church was. In fact, the church was highly resistant to accepting claims of witchcraft, seeing the accusations - quite rightly - as more likely to be an underhanded way for people to settle disputes with their neighbours. Anyone found practising folk magic - and there were people who believed in witchcraft enough to try and attempt it themselves - was more likely to be charged with heresy (a crime they could escape punishment for simply by repenting).

&#x200B;

Also, the title is kind of burying the lead here. The main crimes Agnes Waterhouse and her co-defendants were accused of were killing her husband, harming several other men, and performing an illegal abortion (so it was really as much a poisoning case as witchcraft).

>Elvis Presley
>The King of rock can thank Jerry Lee Lewis' libido for disrupting a challenge to the throne, but Presley wasn't without his own girl problems. Priscilla Presley, Elvis' wife, was just 14 when the couple met. The King's attention quickly overwhelmed her, and by age 17 she was living with Elvis in Graceland. His demands eventually overwhelmed her personality.

>""I was someone he created,' she told the Daily Mail in 2010. ""I was just a kid and I was consumed by him. All I desired was not to disappoint him.""
>Alanna Nash compiled tales from Elvis' lovers in a 2010 book, Baby, Let's Play House: Elvis Presley and the Women Who Loved Him. In the New York Times' review of the book, Janet Maslin noted that the book contains a series of pictures of Elvis' girlfriends, who all share one unsettling physical trait.

>""The pictures tell a powerful story,"" Maslin writes. ""He worked his way through a lifetime’s worth of women who looked like his brown-haired, soulful-eyed mother, Gladys.""


>Jerry Lee Lewis
>Yes, it was 1958. But even back then, a 22-year-old marrying his 13-year-old cousin while still married to another woman was scandalous. And yet that's exactly what Jerry Lee Lewis, one of rock ’n’ roll's most important pioneers, did. It was in 1958 when British journalists learned of the tender young age of Myra Gale Brown, and the ensuing uproar caused Lewis to cancel his tour and spoiled his chance to dethrone Elvis as the king of rock. 

>There's one detail that is particularly unsettling: When Brown moved out of her parents' house to join Lewis on tour, she packed her belongings in the only container she had — her dollhouse.
""It's been as if my life has gone on without my permission. I have been a bystander in my life,"" she told the Philadelphia Enquirer in 1989.
At 14, the couple had a child, who would die in a swimming pool accident three years later. Lewis' infidelity and drug use further strained the marriage, and they got divorced in 1971. Lewis, who is still alive, married for a seventh time in 2012. He kept it in the family again — she was reportedly his cousin's ex-wife",2019-12-04 15:38:53

[How Roadkill Became an Environmental Disaster. To save Brazil’s giant anteaters, scientists are grappling with one of the planet’s most transformative forces: roads.](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/11/roads-brazil-giant-anteaters/602587/)

Relevant section of the article:

>How then, to reduce fragmentation? The de rigueur solution is the installation of wildlife crossings, networks of underpasses and bridges that allow creatures to scamper beneath or over roadways unimpeded. First developed in France, where they’re known as passages à faune, wildlife crossings reached their apogee in Canada’s Banff National Park, where 50 miles of roadside fencing, 38 underpasses, and six overpasses have reduced roadkill by more than 80 percent and permitted more than 200,000 traversals by creatures from wolverines to boreal toads. Fueled by data from Banff and similar projects, crossings have proliferated around the planet. Today underpasses shepherd elephants beneath Kenyan highways, overpasses connect pangolins in Singapore, and bridges usher Christmas Island’s crabs from forest to beach.

Good videos about the wildlife crossings in Banff:

The change in government didn't cause that radical a shift in the Greek war effort, and really it was strong French resistance to further Allied support of Greece combined with the Turkish pact of support signed with the Bolsheviks that resulted in the defeat of the Greek army in the Anatolian interior in the summer of 1921.

Nothing I like more than disconnecting from this world to connect to my memories and look at them.

I could not remember any events from my life for 30 years. First day I took that pill, I could recall anything and everything in real time with full Colors smell and sound.

Information that was dormant for most my life , information I was never able to recall and taught was lost. It was only disconnected for three decade.

My son seems to have that genetics traits from me.

At 5 he can recall stuff I was wearing when he was 2 years old.

The thing he see with his eyes , he can recall automatically when the dots connect with a trigger.

Just like me it’s explosive memories , once triggered , the memory just automatically appears to me in milli seconds.

I always tell my wife if we burp out a quick answers , you can take it to the bank. If we think about the answers , there is chance it will be incorrect.

But when information are regurgitated super quick without active thinking to retrieve it , we are 100% accurate in the answers we give.

Edit 2 : it feel like I have somebody within me taking control and speaking for me. But that somebody is so accurate and fast that I trust it more  than my conscious process that can be faulty , my unconscious process are never faulty.

b) He looks like the alien wearing a human skin in *Men in Black*.

c) It is occasionally possible to sue yourself successfully. AFAIK, it's only possible if you do so when acting in different legal capacities. For example, I recall a woman who, acting as the executor of her late husband's estate, sued herself as a private individual.

We aren't talking about, like, JFK smoking meth he got from some dude in a mobile home somewhere, who'd made it in a horribly dangerous homemade drug lab. Methamphetamine was first created in the form JFK would have been using it around 1900, and was a prescription drug for a huge number of people around the world. It was used by soldiers, routinely, on both sides of both World Wars, as well as by doctors, dentists, and other health professionals to treat a variety of conditions, totally legally. What I'm trying to get at is that JFK using it in the period he lived in would have been an absolutely, entirely different situation, culturally and socially, compared to some world leader doing so today - though I have absolutely no illusions about a great many current world leaders likely being addicts of a variety of different substances, it's a much more secretive thing, now. I'd also like to add I'm neither supporter of meth, or JFK; having said that, going by Khrushchev's word, JFK, despite his inexperience and often ineptitude, did help the position of the USA a bit during the Cold War. I've read more than a few authors and historians suggest that, had Nixon won, we'd have had World War III years ago.   


This next bit doesn't really have to do with the topic at hand, but it has to do with JFK and I find it fascinating, so I'm going to include it as an aside. In the election in which JFK beat Nixon, the first televised debate occurred. These had, in the past, been aired via radio, but never before had American's actually SEEN their presidential candidates debate each other (unless they were present at the debate, I suppose.) Now, people who watched the debate widely held that JFK wrecked Nixon, while people who listened to it on the radio held the total opposite view, that Nixon had won by quite a large margin. JFK likely only won because of his charisma.

He was at the capitol when black panthers showed up armed to hearings about the act. 

Not a lot of people know he was an advocate for gun control in black neighborhoods but pushed gun rights overall. 

Regan was a lot of things but that issue was very hypocritical. The public at the time was vocal about who should have gun rights and the sentiment is echoed today. You can get concealed carry in a lot of counties in California but not in high population areas.

Finally, the designated ‘blue zones’ of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average.

The high score at the time of Em's post was just over 1,000,000 points, which is a pretty far shot from his total, but it's still impressive. A 2014 YouTube playthrough of the game that lands at a similar score takes just over an hour to complete, meaning that for his high score alone, Eminem was sweating and twitching over an arcade cabinet for at least an hour straight, which is more focus than I'm capable of. For what it's worth, The Verge reported in 2014 that top tier players sink thousands of hours of practice into their record-breaking runs, so it's likely that Em had to put some serious time in to hit that mark.

Parents, because younger children who aren't really able to get themselves ready in the morning will have to be accommodated-meaning that some parents would have to make alternative work schedules and arrive home later than usual or those same children would need supervision until the parents can get to them after school.

Students, primarily high school students, were upset because many of them hold after-school jobs.  This later start time along with the accompanying later departure time, would result in many of them not being able to get to their jobs when they are scheduled to do so...and bosses aren't too keen on having to adjust everyone's schedule for the part-timers.

As soon as school started, they hated waking up. It has nothing to do with the time. It has to do with our natural desire to avoid things we dread. We all dread school and work. Nobody wants to go to bed on time if it means getting up to something you dread. Shifting it by an hour is a temporary boost while your natural clock adjusts. Eventually, they'll delay going to bed on the new schedule and the same issue will persist. 



The only way to beat the system is to make the task they are waking up for enjoyable or to keep moving the wake up time after they adapt. Ask any parent what happens on a field trip day or Christmas.

Mainly because schools can't (or don't want to spend the money) afford to pay busing to have both elementary and secondary schools start at the same time because it requires more buses and bus drivers.  Our school district has been looking into this very thing because they see articles like this.  They don't look at the effects that would have on elementary school kids (who need even more sleep than secondary school children).  


IMO, I would like to see both elementary and secondary kids starting at the same time and having schools funded well enough to provide that, and I would like studies to include references about start times for elementary age kids when they do studies like this because if school boards just look at articles like this they won't think about the elementary kids and they'll just switch the start times.",2019-12-03 17:25:25

The problem with this type of shifting the schedule is that it will only continuously encourage ever worse behaviors; i.e.,  if school were started an hour later kids would go to sleep an hour later and get to school tired just like they were when the school started an hour earlier.  The problem, just like with so much stuff today, seems to be rather insanely placed on the symptom; in this case, arbitrary time of day, not the cause, lack of discipline and order to go to be on time to get sufficient amount of sleep … regardless of arbitrary time of day. 

Another point of evidence is that Americans schools already start WAY later than many other school systems around the world that have WAY better educational outcomes. In some countries schools starts as early as 6:30, in Germany it's usually 7:30, while in the USA HS generally starts at 8:30 but especially in HS the first classes can start later.  There is also nothing in the start time rankings that could suggest even the most remote causation in educational outcomes based on PISA rankings that are rather abysmal for the USA, largely simply because of blacks and hispanics, who perform exactly as expected based on their countries of origin.",2019-12-03 22:42:02

One thing I find interesting is 'day dreaming'.  You know, when you are driving down a frequent highway and suddenly you realize that you aren't paying attention, rather, you were fabricating something in your head.

What is the difference between day dreaming and night dreaming?  

While I'm sure there are chemical and electrical differences, I suspect the underlying cause is the same.

It is how our neurons work.  Period.  When we are awake, we apply filters to produce a reasonable output from all that noise... but when we lose focus (as in day dreaming), that noise again rises to the surface.",2019-12-03 15:35:20

For instance, when I've set an alarm by accident for far too early in the morning on a weekend. I'll roll over and go back to sleep, and I'd guess that I dream more often that way. Same goes for nights I feel like I didn't sleep very well, even if it seems like I slept through the whole night.

""Using data from the radar's early observations, the scientists and radar engineers established the locations of 50 unique landmarks on Titan's surface. They then searched for these same lakes, canyons and mountains in the reams of data returned by Cassini in its later flybys of Titan. They found prominent surface features had shifted from their expected positions by up to 30 kilometers (19 miles). A systematic displacement of surface features would be difficult to explain unless the moon's icy crust was decoupled from its core by an internal ocean, making it easier for the crust to move.

""We believe that about 100 kilometers (62 miles) beneath the ice and organic-rich surface is an internal ocean of liquid water mixed with ammonia,"" said Bryan Stiles of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Stiles is a contributing author to the paper.""

""Surface features were observed by the Cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to 30 kilometers (19 mi) between October 2005 and May 2007, which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior, and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer.[28] Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn.[29] Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR-based topography observations[30] also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid.[31][32]""",2019-12-03 13:00:06

This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms….By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able to arrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia during the first nine months of 1944. This is the shortest haul. I cannot see how to do more.

I have resisted for some time the Viceroy’s request that I should ask you for your help, but… I am no longer justified in not asking for your help.20

My five year old is autistic, has ADHD, anxiety, and a brain malformation. Earlier this year we had to seriously consider admitting him to the psychiatric ward because he was a threat to himself and another child. My friend has been there with me through it all. She reassured me when we made the choice to put him on an antipsychotic drug. She's been there with me when my son had to be restrained and has kept him safe in my car while I gathered my other child. She has an autistic teenager and has been through similar things with him. My son really looks up to her big kid and they have a special bond. Spending time with that family allows my older child to feel like he can take a break because so many people there get his brother. I'm so grateful she made us take time for ourselves and I didn't feel guilty or worried at all about leaving my child with her.

As someone who used to give respite, at times only for an hour to parents of children with disabilities, every minute is appreciated more than anyone can understand. I often got paid to do it, but it was the relief on the the parents’ faces that made it worth it. 

If you are ever looking for a volunteer (or paid) opportunity to work with children (including adult children) with disabilities, check out your local special recreation association (by me they are called SRAs). Doing this work gave me invaluable lenses through which I look at my own life, and *man*, they took me to school many a time!

I hate him. I hate him.

>And part of it was, you know, we didn’t have Josh yet. And that’s a huge thing, obviously. And it wasn’t the scratch artist, he was great, but it was that he was — he wanted to be a shoulder because Elsa had these guards. He was half-good and half-bad. He was acerbic. He was a little, I don’t know, he just was kind of mean at times. And I didn’t know why he existed and I didn’t like him.

TL;DR: of course it does.

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/at-what-temperature-does-water-freeze-1120813/
""Scientists have found liquid water as cold as -40 degrees F in clouds and even cooled water down to -42 degrees F in the lab.”

If it's liquid in a cloud and condensing to liquid to make a cloud requires a nucleating particle then there is a nucleating particle for it to freeze on. So why didn't it freeze at +32 F?

Because there's no nucleating particle. Nucleating particles are not required for condensation. QED.

Freezing is slightly trickier, because the entropy can drop in the liquid phase with hydrogen bonds holding the molecules in a liquid formation without rotating the molecules into an ice-forming alignment. But once crystallization starts due to nucleation or an external disturbance or an imperfection in the bond arrangement, you can remove the intervention and the water will finish crystallizing on its own.",2019-12-04 08:11:54

5441,f9irmby,e54aoh,spiderqueendemon,1575344310.0,242,"I still dearly love Victor Hugo for two reasons.

One, I had a favorite babysitter who said I could read aloud to my brother and sister in bed, but ""only one book."" My parents usually found me unconscious around 8am the next morning with a Victor Hugo novel thicker than my whole hand and an utterly dead flashlight, dreaming happily of being Gavroche in the elephant.

And two, I once had an utterly evil 'technology teacher' who didn't actually have so much as her Microsoft Office certifications. She gave us, high school seniors, mind you, attitude for printing out papers that were ""too long,"" (well within the assignment requirements,) because she ""needed the paper."" This, despite our real teachers demanding we turn in paper drafts to be checked and proofread at every stage. 

We found out she was *printing her email.* To read. She was just printing it out. All of it. That was why she was being such a monster to all of us and why we couldn't get paper to print our actual assigned schoolwork. She was just wasting it. The laziness! The slovenly, horrible woman! The...the Thenardiess!

So we hatched a plan.

One of us grandly showed our lovely good sport of an English teacher the Project Gutenberg website, and was immediately and without question allowed to sit in glory for a whole class period, bookmarking every book in the curriculum list. I believe that favorite teacher even gave kid a chocolate bar, glorious woman that she was. Naturally, unsupervised, that student promptly sent an email with a clarification question about meeting scheduling to every other member of the staff, and after about fifteen carriage returns, in 15% gray, Ctrl-V'd the entire text of Victor Hugo's *'Les Miserables'* right into the email.

Every other teacher read the email and thought no more of it. One guy, Science, wondered why the email file size was so much larger than usual despite no pictures, scrolled down, and we found him at lunch somewhere in Montfermeil, very concerned about what was going to happen to poor Cosette.

But the alleged teacher of what purported to be technology?

She printed her email. She printed *every* email.

Including the Hugobomb. 

She printed her five or ten emails she had gotten that morning, went to go annoy her class, and some thirty minutes later, realized the printer had just...not stopped. She yelled at the kids a bit for printing. They, being freshmen, pointed out they hadn't been working long enough to have anything to print, and their teacher, being more than a bit sick of her nonsense every damn trip to the computer lab, backed them up on this. She finally checked the printer.

Jean Valjean was in the printer. A stackful.

She did not, incidentally, know how to turn printing off.

She did not remain our technology teacher.

The vice-principal lined up a certain collection of senior girls and one boy, said she didn't know how we were involved, but she knew we had something to do with it, and don't do it again. Then she stormed out of the room.

The principal gave us just the ghost of a smirk and that year's class treat for everyone on the honor roll was group tickets to go see a national tour of the musical. She beamed at us all when she announced it in assembly a month later and I swear she knew. 

When we left, at graduation, we had a silk tricolored Enjolras scarf from the show and left it on her desk. We all signed inside the box.

So yeah. Still a big Hugo fan. He never sent a sentence to do the job of fifty-eight paragraphs, but sometimes, a wallbanger of a book is what you wanted.",2019-12-03 03:38:30

Fast forward to the present I have ptsd and bipolar depression as well as I’m a recovered addict/alcoholic. Life is great now but my problems started with being bullied. 
     It started at home by a sibling, then people at the bus stop mirrored the behavior, then others on the bus, then the majority of people at the school. It was terrible. Lots of emotional and physical abuse. The principal wouldn’t do anything about it. One day my father told me I was going to have to fight. “Just fight, even if you lose continue fighting.” So I went to school the next day and did just that. The result was I was suspended and threatened expulsion. That’s when I moved to my grandparents and switched school systems.

If your child is a bully, be resposible parents and most importantly be decent human beings, make them stop, you are in charge of your kids not the other way around.

If you have never been subjected to bullying count yourselves immensely fortunate. The pain, agony, humiliation, and dehumanization that follows it is astronomical.

Please be proactive about this matter, don't be care free idiots.

Always keep an eye on your kid, look for the signs, always ask them, investigate and take action.

It has scarred me for life and every time I think I'm over it, it comes back and bites me in the ass.

Bullies and the victims of bullies are both created by narcissistic parenting styles. Bullies are narcissists and the victims are co-dependent. Both are coping styles which they created to defend themselves against their parents. Bullying is a symptom but not the root cause.

So narcissistic parenting creates lifelong damage in adults, including depression, anxiety, social withdrawal because the true cause, namely bad parenting, is hidden. I have been exactly here.

Social withdrawal in the victims result from he/she mostly getting in contact with people who bully them on adult levels. Narcissistic abuse is such a type of adult bullying. As a result their world view gets distorted so much so that they think most people are like this which results in trusting no one anymore.

Have been bullyied at school from maybe 6 to 13yo. Grew up not to trust adults and authority figures because they all didn't care nor even listen. Nearly killed myself at school in anger to ""punish"" them all.

Then decided to ""change"". Took me 3 years to ""reset"" myself as I call it... Basically erased everything in me until I was an empty shell, then filling me with things I wanted to, to define who I wanted to be. I wanted to be a strong and positive guy, above all this shit I lived.

At 15 I get in Lycee (french, don't know how it's called in other, college maybe?) and as many people were new to me, decided to take things in hand. I got to find loneliness people. The guy always on its own, the girl always drawing and not talking to others... People that had no ""voice"", who had been through shit. And we were all ""alone together"", strong against the noisy ones. I gave them a place at school to be at peace at school, and tried to fill them with confidence as much as possible. Learned to fight and protect, and taught some to do so, learned to respond with retort.

By the time I got my diploma, I was a positive leading figure for many bullyied, alone, leftovers and the group grew with every year, elders taking care of the news. Couldn't be more proud of them, and couldn't be more proud of myself for that.

Now I am 32, I got through depression a few times, still not at ease with many people and having social anxiety and impostor syndrome. But i'm still proud of who i a became, and I think that's the best revenge I could have take on all those fuckers.

Still, I can all remember their names and faces, their words and their acts. As I surely trust in forgiveness, sometimes I hesitate to find them on Facebook, just to tell them ""hey, always remember about yourself: you were a dick.""

Notable for a famous scene in which Cagney pushes a grapefruit against Mae Clarke's face, the film thrust him into the spotlight. He became one of Hollywood's leading stars and one of Warner Bros.' biggest contracts. In 1938 he received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for his subtle portrayal of the tough guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan in Angels with Dirty Faces. In 1942 Cagney won the Oscar for his energetic portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961 to spend time on his farm with his family. He came out of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie Ragtime (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.

The show received rave reviews and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929. These roles led to a part in George Kelly’s Maggie the Magnificent, a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney’s performance. Cagney saw this role (and Women Go on Forever) as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned “...what a director was for and what a director could do. They were directors who could play all the parts in the play better than the actors cast for them.”

In Saudi Arabia born and raised

In the desert is how I spent most of my days

Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool

Shootin at the females tryna go to school

When a couple of guys, they were up to no good, 

Built a forward base in the neighborhood

Got in one little fight and the sergeant said

You’re moving off to prison, watch your head


We sailed into the prison bout 7 or 8

Along with some bombers who didn’t detonate

Looked at my confines

I’m here to be the Prince of Guntanamo Bay",2019-12-02 23:57:14

There is also a copy of the the very first Lord of the Rings film script (not the Peter Jackson one) where the writer couldn't remember how to spell the characters' names and decided to cut out large parts of the books for the film; you can see Tolkien's notes in the margins and they get angrier and angrier as the script goes on. They also (or at least did when I visited) had framed copies of the very last chapter of the Return of the King, which never saw publication.

Been out of the game for a while (~10yrs), but we didn’t used to have RFID on anything less than $1000. All the cash plaques ($10,000+) had them plus barcodes and other I’d measures inside them that you literally had to snap the plastic to check.

These days they probably put them in the $500s maybe, but no way they’re in every chip.

After sitting on many dead tables for many hours, assessing their security measures, my judgement is this:

It’s actually really easy to steal from a casino in small amounts, but honestly anything worth stealing is much harder and just not worth the risk. 

Seen too many people fail to comprehend this and get criminal records for a few thousand dollars. To put it in perspective, most people will earn/spend WAY over $1,000,000 across their lifetime.

mostly, though, we use the RFID to get accurate player average bets. every player spot will instantly read your bet. this allows us to give a truly accurate average bet. if you sit out hands, it counts that, if you move your bet, it will average based on the number of hands you play.

we also have tech in the chip racks that will give a (fairly) accurate read on how many chips you have in the rack. This can give you a pretty accurate instant read on how that table is performing.

if you also include an iShoe or smart shoe, you can combine the tech to identify card counters. the shoe tracks the hands, the rfid chips track when you move your bet up or down, and if it looks like your bet moves with the count it red flags that play session for further investigation.",2019-12-03 05:03:26

Fingerprints analysis isn’t done like on CSI were they put print A next to print B and the computer overlays them. A fingerprint, even if from the same finger, can vary quite considerably depending on the pressure and angle of the impression. What we are trying to demonstrate is not that the print match, but that the print could have been created by this finger, AND that it is very unlikely that another finger could have created such print.

What we are looking for is minutiae: tiny designs, like forks, ridge ends and islands, in the design. If we see a certain number of matching minutiae, AND no unexplained differences (because stuff like too much ink while taking the print can hide them), then we can declare “it is x times more likely that the suspect’s finger is the source of the fingerprint, then another finger”.

[Louis-Émile Vanderburch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-%C3%89mile_Vanderburch) and [Ferdinand Langlé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Langl%C3%A9)'s 1833 play *Le Camarade de lit* (""The Bedfellow"") depicts Bernadotte as King of Sweden; an old grenadier claims that, as a young man, Bernadotte received a [tattoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo) of a scandalous republican motto: either *Mort aux Rois* (""Death to kings""), or *Mort aux tyrans* (""Death to tyrants""), or *Mort au Roi* (""Death to the king""). The tattoo is finally revealed to read *Vive la république* (""Long live [the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Republic)"") and a [Phrygian cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_cap): a highly [ironic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic) image and text for the skin of a king.[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden#cite_note-99)  This play was so popular that the idea that King Charles XIV John had a  tattoo reading ""Death to kings"" is often repeated as fact, although  there is no basis to it.[\[100\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden#cite_note-100)[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden#cite_note-101)[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden#cite_note-102) However, it is true that Bernadotte wrote in 1797, ""Being a [republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism) both by principle and by conviction, I want to fight all [royalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalist) to my death.""[\[103\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden#cite_note-103)",2019-12-02 14:14:35

Worried that baldness would hurt his reputation, Louis hired 48 wigmakers to save his image. Five years later, the King of England—Louis’s cousin, Charles II—did the same thing when his hair started to gray (both men likely had syphilis). Courtiers and other aristocrats immediately copied the two kings. They sported wigs, and the style trickled down to the upper-middle class. Europe’s newest fad was born.

>The cost of wigs increased, and perukes became a scheme for flaunting wealth. An everyday wig cost about 25 shillings—a week’s pay for a common Londoner. The bill for large, elaborate perukes ballooned to as high as 800 shillings. The word “bigwig” was coined to describe snobs who could afford big, poufy perukes.

The Asian beetle is a type of insect that can act as a parasite, secreting a sticky substance that attaches it to the host where it can live relatively unharmed. The beetles don't necessarily take any nutrients from the host, however they can cause a pretty uncomfortable sensation, especially where these were found (on the roof of a dog's mouth). The beetles' presence can also lead to infection in the dog's mouth if left untouched for long enough.

 We devised a method of introducing water to a fuel tank, then running the mix through a water-seperator to also remove the ethanol.  It is a costly procedure, but some boats had 100+ gallons of fuel, so it was worth saving.

Finally, after a quarter, or two, the company's kaizen plan is implemented. Biweekly meetings and progress reports continue. Only this time they are to track the changes and gains via predetermined and unchanging metrics.

Documented changes are required from every department, regardless of current efficiency of the departments.

I work at a place that is very heavily reliant on Kai (Change) zen (Good). I hear alot of mention of financial reimbursement, but honestly that is the most minimal driving factor in my approach to Kaizen (Although it seems the primary means  many companies try to half ass integrate it as a cost savings measure) . I have the awesome opportunity to basically  help develop, conceptualize, test, and integrate the ideas with my co workers for process/machine improvements (Anyone can ID an issue or a potential improvement and If they would like assistance they can grab me) . The biggest reason I make these changes and improvements are #1 to help my co workers, they are great people with amazing ideas and each of us has how own gifting to contribute and just helping them design tools that make their jobs betters, more efficient or just less frustrating is a huge value to me in having meaning to the work im doing beyond saving a company money. The #2 for me is I AM LAZY, I just happen to have a eh descent work ethic, but I always want to optimize my laziness while maintaining the same amount of productivity. If I can find ways to optimize my work flow or improve process's that I am regularly working within the person who benefits most is myself. If I can  remove one shitty process or improve it to the point where its markedly less shitty at least over time my job gets noticeably less frustrating. Its amazing the cumulative impact of those consistent small changes over time, and really to me, yes I am helping the company but more importantly I get a chance to help those around me...I am also lucky enough to work for some people who are genuine and demonstrate their beliefs and intent through action not just some happy go lucky full of garbage company statement.

&#x200B;

Any who, I guess in summary my experience with Kaizen has shown me the potential that is there for both business's and employees...But it requires a moral transition and a genuine investment in a companies people...Invest in your people and yeah sometimes it wont pan out but I would venture to say a vast majority  of the time it yields a positive outcome.",2019-12-02 13:22:38

That said, I've yet to work somewhere that valued such things.  I've sat in meetings with HR, where they worked to imply that I needed permission to feel accomplishment.  I've witnessed coworkers and middle management take credit for my work in clearly superior cases, otherwise dismissal and denigration.  I've been relied upon for technical knowledge, to be dismissed upon delivery.  Then I get to see coworkers working to investigate my claims, come to the same conclusion...  Once in a while I see karma, as someone has to concede the situation.  And then the cycle repeats, because that's what happens when dealing with a narcissist.  You can change jobs, but the same sort of people can be expected in any organization.

The last aspect is the reaction to a solution.  I'd like to describe the situation has ""hilarious"" because everyone talked about how the outgoing process was.  After all, that's why the discussion, plan, and subsequent implementation happened.  Now you have people asking for the old stuff back...  That's who you come to see the people who realize they've lost some form of power, or maybe are lashing out because they are either jealous or come close to comprehending their mediocrity.

In the majority of cases I simply didn't let anyone in management know; I just got my day's work done in ten minutes or thereabouts. In some cases, I improved other people's workflows by orders of magnitude in less than a day. Not because I was doing anything genius-level, but mostly because government processes often hadn't changed for years or decades even when better options had become available. Often, it was as simple as actually allowing the computer they were doing manual processes on to actually do the boring and repetitive bits because the original process had been created before the department got PC workstations, and sometimes even before mainframes.

All I had to do was look at the work coming in, what needed to go out, and ask what the best and fastest way to do it with the least resources was. And once I looked at the incoming work and classified it into ""work that actually needs to be done and done by this particular team"" (18%) and ""everything else"" (82%), and worked out how to stop the unnecessary crap turning up. And that was on top of any actual efficiency improvements in the work itself, which were about another doubling in capacity.

Really, it was purely that no-one had bothered to ever just *look* at any of these things. At one point, I ran across a team who had full access to Microsoft Office but would spend an entire day typing out all the things they had to do, printing the list off, manually using scissors to cut the tasks into task strips, and then manually pasting them to a big sheet of cardboard in approximate order of importance.

Someone transfers into the shop and says ""at my old base, we had a way of doing this 10-minute job in 9 minutes.""

Now everyone has to be retrained on the new method. That takes time. And then the first few times they do it, they end up doing it wrong, so the quality of the job is now worse than if they just did it the old way.

Then you have the people who were on different shifts, on vacation, TDY, or who are deployed for months who never got the training, and now you have to deal with retraining people when they get back, months later.

Plus, now the people who actually were there for the initial training forgot the new method, so they just go back to the way they were doing it for years. Sure, the new procedure is written in the SOP, but nobody actually reads it.

They were able to do this because they would have a factory for each type of car their company produced. So you've got a factory for sedans, one for trucks, one for hatchbacks, etc. The Japanese were unable to do this do space limitations of their country so they would have to produce more then one type, or even all of the types of car their company produced in one factory.

If a comet passed the earth then the ancients had a variety of calamitous results ranging from many different cultures. Plagues, monarchs dying, bad harvests, sometimes the gods were literally attacking humanity directly.

Also back in the olden days, there weren't many descriptions for things in the sky. You had the sun and moon, heavenly bodies that moved (planets), and stars (the Latin word for which is Astro or, Astra if plural).

So if this star looking thing turns up in the night sky and starts to move rapidly through the course of the night all while projecting a giant friggin tail of bright light, some poor pre Galileo sod would shit his only pair of britches and assume Satan, Hades, Set, Loki, or some other evil deity had dislodged a star and aimed it at earth where it started leaking magic all over the place.",2019-12-02 13:37:52

I know first handily how difficult the struggles of all the sudden no longer being wanted or needed are... brushed away by people who had so readily embraced you and extolled your virtues for as long as you put money in their pockets. Then to be disregarded, and the mental health struggles that come with that... it’s psychotic. my biggest fear during that period in my life was to die in this same way... forgotten and alone. Substance abuse is rampant with child actors, even the ones you wouldn’t think are users.. the amount of home support and insulation required to maintain is incredible... let me just say that... in light of Honey Boy coming out... as I spent many many years with Labouf... he never was disregarded by anyone. He was a golden child from the beginning.. who got paid millions of dollars by the time he was 18 to star in pictures, and continued to get the opportunity for over an entire decade while most of us struggled to not slip into obscurity. He was not abused, and all the bullshit that happened was by his own doing, not as the narrative of his new film would have you believe... it’s all optics.... a kid like Bobby? Clearly it was because he had zero support and home life. His mother didn’t even know he was missing for how long? It all starts there, at home... without a beautiful family who loves and supports you no matter what... when the inevitable occurs, when the phone stops ringing because you’ve grown up... you better hope that safety nets were put into place.. otherwise it will be a lifetime of mental health struggles. So many of us go that way. The mental and emotional fortitude required to overcome if you are like me, and had parents who did the exact opposite as they should have... used and taken and then threw me away when I didnt pay them anymore... it’s so damaging... my heart feels so painfully for this kid... Peter Pan was such a significant part of most of our lives... take a moment to just reflect on everything kid actors give... poor fucking kid.",2019-12-02 16:53:33

London decided not to make contact with Gordievsky once he was home – too risky – but to have a procedure in place if he raised the alarm.

>The plan was simple, and almost comic. At 7.30pm on Tuesdays British officers would watch a bread shop next to Kutuzovsky Prospekt, a diplomatic complex. In an emergency, Gordievsky would turn up wearing a grey cap and holding a plastic Safeway bag. The MI6 officer would walk past him munching a Mars bar or a KitKat.

It is simultaneously unbelievable and entirely credible at the same time. There's some absolutely bonkers cold war stuff in it. If a Russian spy wants to target his handler he is to place a drawing pin in the banister rail above the third step of platform two on Baker St Tube station. And yet somehow this was precisely how it was all done. It's a great read, one of the best cold war books I've read and highly recommended. 

I also really liked The Most Dangerous Place on Earth - Berlin 1961  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Berlin-1961-Kennedy-Khrushchev-Dangerous/dp/0425245942](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Berlin-1961-Kennedy-Khrushchev-Dangerous/dp/0425245942) 

Gives you a superb insight into what was going on in the minds of Kennedy and Khrushchev at the time. Also by a journalist and very cleverly uses the declassified papers from both sides of the iron curtain to stitch together the narrative using what each side *thought* the other side was doing and thinking vs what they were *actually* thinking and doing.

At some point in the late 1890s, she underwent brain surgery at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. Unable to sleep because of pains and ""buzzing"" in her head, she asked a doctor if he could operate. He agreed and, in her words, ""sawed open my skull, and raised it up, and now it feels more comfortable"".[165] She had received no anesthesia for the procedure and reportedly chose instead to bite down on a bullet, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were amputated.[166]

This analysis is in keeping with the guidance of the Sixth Circuit in Daddy's, where the court instructed the district court to evaluate how the common nature of the phrase ""Daddy's"" affected the strength of the plaintiff's marks. See Daddy's, 109 F.3d at 282. In addition, the most prominent portion of each mark is not the shared ""zone"" portion but the initial syllables. Accord Jet, 165 F.3d at 423.

The brain’s executive function – which plans and  makes decisions – comes into play as a musician plays one part but keeps  focus on what’s coming next.  Couple that with the total sensory input –  visual, auditory, emotional and all at the same time – and **it becomes a  total “workout” for the brain.** “Recent studies suggest that music may  be a uniquely good form of exercising your brain,” he said. “Fun can  also be good for you.”

But there's more!

This man was a Spanish farmer. Knew squat about spying but really hated some god damned fascists. Since Spain was officially neutral but helping Germany on the side, he decided to present himself as a spy for the allies. They rejected him repeatedly so he went to the GERMANS and applied to be a spy. They said yes! So he starts sending them all this BS info and becomes a TOP RANKING GERMAN OPERATIVE. 

Eventually, the allies keep hearing about this badass german spy through their decoders. They know there are no spies in Britain because they have long since cracked the Nazi spy codes and routinely just scoop up any Gerrys that are dropped into their midst. Plus, all the info that is being passed through Garcia is BS and obviously  BS from someone who has never set foot in the country. 

The Brits start asking around after this guy and sure enough, this embassy has been repeatedly contacted by Garcia claiming that he is a German spy with Intel for the allies and they never believed him!

So quick like and in a hurry, the Brits scoop him up and start giving him real intel (real but useless) to pass to the Germans. They manage to feed them enough false info through Garcia to convince them that the invasion would happen in Calais, not Normandy. This was called Operation Fortitude and it turned the tide of the conflict with Germany.",2019-12-01 06:13:41

The metal was not particularly sharp, it had been cut years ago. So the person went to the hospital and got stitches and tried to get the city to reimburse them. The city's reply was the same as posted here; they did not know about the hazard and so were not responsible. But, almost immediately they removed this stub (now that they knew about it), which was nice. (someone removed it and back filled with cement, and I am assuming it was not the buisiness adjacent to the post)

There are several of these in the same area, and I have take photos of them and sent them to the city, department of public works. And none of them are being removed, which surprised me. But now they know of them and a future claim could be made, if the person trips in front of me I will let them know. Not sure if anyone would know to ask the city for any records regarding any reports letting them know. In the case above, the person did not involve a lawyer. They just wanted the ER visit to be paid for. A lawyer might have sued and then asked in discovery for any cases of reporting the hazard.

The other thing was that it was highly likely that the city cut the sign originally. These signs are all about road/city information. Likely a sign about parking hours in this particular place. So the ""city"" did know, but it is possible no one working in the city now knows. I wonder how the law would treat this? The effect of the trial lawyers creating a database is that there will always be this record, so even if the city engineering department turns over, the city can't claim ignorance.

Also, I have noticed that all the new posts have a different mounting system. Rather than being set in concrete the new posts are mounted in a small stand, sort of like a Christmas tree stand. And the stand is screwed into the concrete. So, now if they want to remove the sign, they can unscrew the base and you are only left with four small holes in the concrete.",2019-12-01 16:06:40

8265,f9b4r66,e484q5,JamieA350,1575209286.0,3,"In some defence of the window tax - it was actually a rather progressive tax for the time, if flawed. Lord Poshwanker's country mansion-house would have a lot more windows than a typical inner-city worker's terraced house, say. After the Act of Union the tax only applied once you had so many windows and there were often exemptions if you were poor anyway. [Here's the Scottish record of the tax](https://webarchive.nrscotland.gov.uk/20170203100413/https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/guides/taxation-records):

> Names of householders, number of houses and number of windows in houses with seven or more windows

[Or in England](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/towns/tyne-and-wear-case-study/about-the-group/housing/window-tax/):

> It was intended to be a progressive tax in that houses with a smaller number of windows, initially ten, were subject to a 2 shilling house tax but exempt from the window tax.  Houses with more than ten windows were liable for additional taxes which increased in line with the number of windows.  The poorest, who were more likely to live in houses with fewer windows, were therefore in theory taxed less.  This principle generally worked when applied to the rural poor, but failed to alleviate the tax burden on the urban poor. 

I put it to you that a typical working-class terrace/rowhouse like [this early 19th century example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Theed_Street%2C_Waterloo_-_geograph.org.uk_-_654705.jpg) would not have had 10 windows. You can definitely see where the idea came from. However, as the England page puts it:

> In towns and cities it was unusual for the working classes to live in individual homes.  They would usually live in large tenement buildings which, however they had been subdivided, where considered to be one dwelling house under the terms of the tax, and therefore subject to heavy window tax assessments.



Bear in mind income taxes were very controversial and in turn much of the West only got them in the late 19th or even early 20th century. I would argue that it's no coincidence that the Window tax was scrapped just a few years after the first GB-wide income tax.",2019-12-01 14:08:06

* WentAWOL from the US military and spent 2 months in a mental hospital.
* Was happy when Elvis received his draft notice because Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him. Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.
* Persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier instead of joining the Special Services, which would have allowed him the opportunity to continue to perform. 
* Didn't attempt to prevent Elvis from being drafted because he was afraid it would result in a more detailed look into his own service record.
* Was concerned about outside influence that Presley might come across in Germany so he sent his business associates and Presley's friends to watch over him. He was also afraid that Presley would find out that other managers didn't take a 25% cut. 
* Kept Elvis locked into movie contracts that put little to no importance on quality or his client's wishes. As Presley's popularity waned, Parker ensured the movies were made cheaply and quickly in order to maximize profits. 
* Renegotiated his contract with Elvis in 1967 that increased his take from 25% to 50%.
* Pushed Elvis to get married in order to ""tame"" him because Elvis was showing signs of rebellion again. Parker also used the wedding as publicity to boost Elvis's career. 
* Signed a 50/50 ""partnership agreement with Elvis for his month-long stint in Las Vegas in 1969. Parker controlled merchandising and other non-music related items, which resulted in him earning more than his client.
* Sold Elvis's entire back catalog to RCA for $5.4 million in 1973. This meant that after his death, Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973.
* Turned down an offer of $5 million for Elvis to perform in Saudi Arabia in 1975. When they offered $10 million, he turned that down too.
* Persuaded Presley's father, at Elvis's funeral, to sign over control of Presley's career in death to him.
*  Advised Elvis not to sign up for songwriting credits, which cost Elvis (and Parker) millions in royalties.",2019-12-01 00:30:02

8693,f97me88,e43s1p,Syllogism19,1575167537.0,1,">The Japanese government imposed voluntary export restraints for the U.S. market, so it was more profitable for Japanese automakers to export more expensive cars to the U.S. 

This is also why instead of the low priced entry level Toyota and Datsun hatchbacks and sedans that young people bought in the 70's we had light duty 1/2 ton pickups in the 80s. Young men in particular bought them since they were much lower priced than the entry level sedans (American or Japanese). 

They were also excluded under US law from some safety requirements including steel beams in the doors to protect the occupants when hit from the side since it was assumed when the regulations were made that they would exclusively be used on the farm.

Some time in the 1990's I read a report that compared the expected numbers of deaths when driving small cars compared to those expected when driving the half ton pickups. In addition to the missing safety features the fact that small pickups were more likely to swerve than a small car contributed to more fatalities per mile driven in the pickups vs a small car.

As I recall the number of people who died because they were driving these small pickups instead of small cars was on the order of 600 per year.

Once the controls were lifted the market for small pickups in the US dried up but the Japanese used their reputation and expertise at building the small ones to go into building the big boys that they sell today.

All in all the export restraints ended up hurting the US car industry by pushing the Japanese out of the low cost niche in which they had been nestled.",2019-12-01 02:32:17

""Is virtue signalling a perversion of morality?

People engage in moral talk all the time. When they make moral claims in public, one common response is to dismiss them as virtue signallers. Twitter is full of these accusations: the actress Jameela Jamil is a ‘pathetic virtue-signalling twerp’, according to the journalist Piers Morgan; climate activists are virtue signallers, according to the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research; vegetarianism is virtue signalling, according to the author Bjorn Lomborg (as these examples illustrate, the accusation seems more common from the Right than the Left).


Accusing someone of virtue signalling is to accuse them of a kind of hypocrisy. The accused person claims to be deeply concerned about some moral issue but their main concern is – so the argument goes – with themselves. They’re not really concerned with changing minds, let alone with changing the world, but with displaying themselves in the best light possible. As the journalist James Bartholomew (who claimed in 2015 to have invented the phrase, but didn’t) puts it in The Spectator, virtue signalling is driven by ‘vanity and self-aggrandisement’, not concern with others.


Ironically, accusing others of virtue signalling might itself constitute virtue signalling – just signalling to a different audience. Whether it should be counted as virtue signalling or not, the accusation does exactly what it accuses others of: it moves the focus from the target of the moral claim to the person making it. It can therefore be used to avoid addressing the moral claim made.""

This was probably 2008 or so in Lubbock Texas. Relatively small store but had about 50 people in it - mostly men between the ages of 16 and 25. It smelled like a latrine. I immediately had to walk out covering my mouth. I didn't want to, I promise. It just literally was that wretched in there.

I have a couple of theories about how it gets so bad.

On the one hand, obviously the hygiene stuff: No deodorant. Probably didn't bathe that morning. General lack of self-awareness when it comes to body odor and sweat.

But my other theory comes down to clothes. I have a friend who very much fit that Yu-Gi-Oh demographic back when we were that age and his biggest ""crime of body odor"" wasn't forgetting to bathe or wear deodorant. He was just too lazy to wash his clothes regularly. I honestly think he got up in the morning, picked an old shirt off the floor, smelled it, and if it wasn't what he considered stinky or ripe, he felt it was ok to put it on.

So I want to add something to the deodorant talk: Yo, wash your clothes, too. If you think that shirt you wore yesterday is probably good for another day, you're wrong. Get a roll of quarters and head your ass down to the laundromat. Heck, bring your Yu-Gi-Oh cards. Maybe if you all go at once, you can start a tournament right there.",2019-12-01 02:54:34

*The village had been one of the White Villages of Andalusia, with buildings traditionally whitewashed. In spring 2011, buildings in the village (including the church) were painted smurf-blue by Sony España to celebrate the premiere of the Smurfs movie.[2] 4,000 litres (880 imp gal; 1,100 US gal) of paint were used. While the original agreement with Sony España included painting the village white after its promotional ended, in December 2011, the village hall organised a special referendum vote for the village residents to determine if the village would remain blue or revert to white; the referendum results indicated the village would continue as blue with no date for reverting to white. One indication as to why might be that an estimated 95,000 tourists visited the village in the six months following the blue paint job and that the village had previously seen about 9,000 tourists annually*

The mountain road to get there was super narrow and at points you had to have one car reverse till it go wide enough for two cars to squeeze past each other, with no barrier on the mountain edge, which would explain the odd crashed car (not from the day we drove) down the mountainside

Locals were friendly but they definitely hadn't really catered to tourism even though it was still buzzing with tourists.Usually in these kinds of villages you get nice little bars that do a menu del día but all they had was basic bars with sub par food. Other nearby villages were much better.

If I didn't live nearish by I'd have been annoyed if I'd have done a long drive to see it. So yeah, don't bother going.

>Released in June 2011, despite being beaten to the top of the Box Office charts by Cowboys & Aliens, Smurfs 3D went on to take $563.7 million. More than five times what it cost to make the movie.

>Although Sony vowed to restore the village to its former whitewashed look, six months after the premiere, the residents voted to keep the colour, which had brought more than 80,000 tourists to the village of Júzcar.

>People began coming from all over the world to explore the village and its surroundings, an average of 250 per day. What was once a sleepy village with very little tourism, except for hikers, was now a bustling tourist destination.

However, if a snake is bitten by a venomous snake of another species, it probably will be affected.

This is probably because snakes have evolved to be immune to venom from their own species, because bites from mates or rivals of the same species probably happen fairly often.Many people believe that snakes are immune to their own venom so that they don’t get harmed when eating an animal it has just injected full of venom.

But in fact, they don’t need to be immune. Scientists have found that special digestive chemicals in the stomachs of most vertebrates (animals with backbones) break down snake venom very quickly. So the snake’s stomach can quickly deal with the venom in the animal it just ate before it has a chance to harm the snake.",2019-11-30 20:14:56

The bill introduced into parliament dropped the women’s suffrage, in order to successfully revoke plural voting. This is because voting had traditionally been tied to property ownership. Rich property owners got to vote, and if they had multiple properties, they had multiple votes. 

When universal suffrage was successful in 1902, it brought in universal suffrage for women to be able to vote in Australia, but also for men, because at that time not all Australian men were able to vote.

This is not far off suffrage movements worldwide, where men’s suffrage came as a result of overturning laws pertaining to only rich landowners being able to vote. Usually women’s suffrage happened within a generation of men’s suffrage, for most countries worldwide.

For some countries, war was a factor in suffrage, as there was a time when men were being forced to fight and die for their country, yet did not have the right to vote.

This is also why only a minority of women supported  women’s suffrage but a majority did not. They did not want to have the rights of a citizen, with regards to voting, if it meant they also had to endure the responsibilities of one, such as civil service and conscription.",2019-11-30 20:10:56

There was a tradition in the Imperial German army that men could only be promoted to Field Marshal if they won a major battle. This caused problems after the Franco - Prussian War as some generals were promoted. Some people wanted to give the Kaiser the highest military rank also. Traditionalists objected, so they created a new rank between general and field marshal, Colonel-General. This became the highest rank in peacetime.

The UK has stopped promotions to 5 stars for ordinary soldiers. But as always the royals are a special case, and so it continues for them.

Napoleon never bothered with his own promotion, though he created many marshals. De Gaulle refused promotion, because he saw himself as equal to Napoleon, and didn't need it.

I went to Japan in 2015 on a little vacation, and got to try real Wasabi for the first time! I tried it in two different ways, and I'll relate those here.

The first time was at a little chain of conveyor belt sushi called Genki. The wasabi came in little packets (about the size of the salt & pepper paper packets you see in the states), and I could feel the texture of the root. The flavor was so much *more* than horseradish, but I can't think of a better way to put it. We snagged a bunch of little packets of wasabi to bring back with us.

On our final night in the country, we asked our hotel manager if she knew any good sushi places nearby. It was POURING rain, like walking a block under an umbrella still soaks your pants to the knee. Anyway, she called a number, spoke a bunch of Japanese of which we only heard the word Gaijin, or outsider/ foreigner. The gist was that she called her fave spot & asked if they were okay having a couple filthy Americans show up. She hung up the phone & gave us directions, and we splashed down the dark streets of the outskirts of Tokyo.

We walked into a little restaurant with all the chairs on the tables (maybe 8 at night?), which threw us off for a moment. The proprietor mimed a phone being held to his ear, we nodded, and he aimed us to an out-of-the-way staircase. We tromped up to the second floor, where a single old man stood behind a sushi counter with about a dozen older Japanese people seated. They invited us in, and the Grandma with the most English asked us about our trip while we all ate. This was the kind of place that you eat what the chef gives you, and you like it. I embarrassed myself by dipping the rice in the soy, and the chef visibly cringed before almost slapping my wrist. He demonstrated what I was supposed to do, as gently as he could. The Wasabi he used was in root form, shredded right before he handed over the pieces of sushi, and it was VERY aromatic.

The oldsters liked hearing about all the places we had gone, and seemed almost flattered that we had chosen their little joint as our final stop. Everyone was exceedingly nice to us, and I'll absolutely never forget that night.",2019-11-30 21:38:23

I have a pair of 15 year old Rockports that my then girlfriend purchased for me back in 2003. The shoes are very worn obviously, but still have many years left. Keep in mind I've been wearing them a few times a week for 15 years. Believe it or not, the original soles of the shoes are still in great condition. 

It's shocking how little wear there is given how much I walk. The leather on the top of the shoe is in worse condition and has cracks, drying out, etc. I never really did any of the leather conditioner stuff. Despite this, I've never, *ever* had a pair of shoes last me longer than a year, 2 tops after daily use -- except for my 15yr old rockports. The soles would wear out till holes formed, or the back part of the heal would simply wear down, etc.

Until 2005, Reebok owned Rockport (bought them in 1986) but didn't mess with how their shoes are manufactured. They were manufactured in Europe somewhere (Hungry I believe). Reebok let them continue making great quality shoes the same way they were originally made before the purchase. They just let them continue to do their thing.

Enter Adidas. They acquired Rockport in 2005 and essentially ruined the company. They moved manufacturing to China and begun using subpar materials. At this point, they were like any other shoe brand manufactured in China on the cheap. I've purchased 3 pairs of shoes from them since the 'change' and all three died a year after use... almost to the day. It was obvious they are horribly constructed now. 

The sad thing is, I see this same set of events happening to Allen Edmonds. I don't know if anyone has purchased from them prior to the company being sold, but the quality has started to drop significantly over this last year or two.

Those things are part of our culture and history, being able to see what any form of media was like with all of its connective tissue and imperfections intact is special and should be preserved.

WJSV started out as WTRC in Brooklyn; started by the Twentith District Republican Club. They were trying to win a battle between the ""regular republicans"" (them) and the resurging KKK. 

For whatever reason, The TDRC lost the station and it came in to the control of James S. Vance Jr - grand wizard of the KKK and publisher of The Fellowship Forum. In fact, the original desired call letters were WTFF. They didn't get those, so instead it was renamed WJSV. The story is the letters were supposed to stand for Jesus Loves Virginia; but also happen to be the initials of the grand wizard that owned the station. 

It was very much known as a KKK station. There's little documentation as to how much of a propaganda station it was...Vance claimed none. 

So fast forward to 1931. The 50 watt station isn't ideal and they want more power; so they contract to CBS to be an affiliate. CBS will provide programming and be responsible for engineering costs. 

There's a problem...CBS wants *nothing* to do with the Klan; but they also want the chance to have their own station rather than affiliate with another. So CBS negotiated to outright by WJSV; and by 1932 it was no longer owned by the klan.

WJSV was on 1460kHz up untill 1941; at which the NARBA reallocated/moved stations. WJSV's new frequency became 1500kHz. I think it was 1943 when CBS bought the call letters WTOP from a police department in Ohio and WJSV became WTOP 1500AM as they were at the ""top"" of the dial.

 At the same time they should be educated that c-section is not good for a babies microbiome. As they pass through the natural passage they are taking the mothers bacteria as their own, which helps the baby's immune system with diseases and disorders. probably helps their children's genetics. This transfer of the mothers biome probably is probably the most important time for a baby's immune system. 

I was reading that they took a microbiome of an older mouse and put it in a younger mouse. This can be an extremely dangerous thing to do as it can contain harmful viruses, fungi and others. But it helped the younger mouse's microbiome be stronger than the old mouse. The biome has a younger stronger host to strive in. 

But natural birth is simular as it transfers the biome from the birthing passage. With a c-section they are exposed to a blank sterile environment. This is bad for the babies diversity of microbiome they need more studies to change procedure with c-section to expose them to good bacteria with maybe even some kinda pill form. But there is a lack of research into the biome of babies being born and the mothers vagina biome. This could make a huge leap into healthier children.",2019-11-30 13:13:37

9556,f950rjj,e3v479,Random_Username9105,1575114238.0,8,"The specific passage if you don't want to read the rest of the interview:

> Komodo dragons naturally evolved to feed on 40 to 50-kilo prey  animals like pigs and deer. When they feed on their natural sized prey,  they kill 90 per cent of that prey in the first three or four hours. 75  per cent of the prey bleed out in the first 30 minutes and another 15  per cent continue bleeding and die within three or four hours. That is  one of the things that people have seen, but haven’t clicked on. When a  dragon bites something, it keeps bleeding. Its victim seems to rapidly  go into shock and bleeds and bleeds. That is what is the venom is doing.  We have shown that the Komodo dragons have an anti-coagulant in their  venom as well as other venom components that drop the blood pressure. It  all combines to a steady march towards unconsciousness. The dragon can  then tear the head off at its leisure.  
>  
>The primary Komodo dragon weapon is actually the teeth. They have  these very flat, large, double-serrated teeth. When they bite, they bite  and they pull straight back, so they leave parallel deep cuts. It is  like with a saw, each cut follows the other one and each notch goes a  little deeper. It is the same thing with their teeth. It is basically  grip and rip. The mechanical damage alone from the teeth wounds is  enough to kill in some cases. For example, on Rinca, where we do a lot  of our research, an eight-year-old boy was killed there a couple of  years ago. He went and squatted in the bushes and a big dragon came up,  got him and cut right here (*indicates*). The dragon sliced right  through the boy’s femoral artery. That mechanical damage, the tissue  damage, is enough to kill. The blood spurt was about two metres from his  leg. But it was a little unclear whether he died from that or from when  the dragon then grabbed him mid-body and smashed his head against a  tree. That caved in his head and the dragon ran off with the body while  being chased by the family.  
>  
>They are very formidable animals and they can kill in a multitude of  ways. The venom is that it is not like a death adder or a taipan venom,  where the venom is the only weapon. The Komodo dragon bites, sits back  and its victim dies. Here the venom is to support or to supplement the  tooth damage. It is a combined arsenal system. You have the teeth as the  primary weapon and the wounds which don’t close up. If you don’t die  outright from cutting a femoral artery, you are going to keep bleeding  until you are out of blood and then you are dead.

And there they were, naked, starved, dead and been pushed into a pit by a dozer while the guards, the torturers, the people who lived in the next town were dressed in fine clothes doing all of the thing these people would never get a chance to do again.

How do you process that? Can a single person even begin to fathom the depth and complexity of the lives that were brutally and cruelly snuffed out?

Edit: A lot of people have been commenting about what is happening to the Uighurs Muslims currently in China. No, I’m not trying to downplay anything that those poor people are going through it’s a terrible, travesty that is looking like, if not stopped, it could turn out that way. However, It is certainly not as bad at its current point than the Holocaust was. For anyone that hasn’t done any sort of research or read or watched anything on the holocaust you probably should. Just the sheer scale of the amount of people that died in such a short time is almost inconceivable only comparable in history to Mao’s reign as of yet. 

Someone else brought up there all Rwandan genocide in the 2000s which makes me happy that people even know about it. However. It was a very different circumstance and still in comparable. 

I bring this up because I’ve legitimately met people in the US that will talk about our migrant detention centers as if they are even in the same league as the Holocaust and it disgusts me. 

I’m not trying to upset anyone either, but when you look at the sheer numbers of the holocaust it really does do a disservice to it when illogical comparisons are made. Yes there are terrible things being done in today’s world, yes I feel terrible for them and wish them towish them to stop, yes I have empathy for people going through hardships right now, but if you look at the history, comparing anything to the holocaust really needs to be done with a grain of salt.",2019-11-30 07:31:36

The whole thing is held up by massive subsidies and unhealthy factory farming techniques, and it probably SHOULD be, since food is a critical, inelastic resource and it’s easy for farmers to be affected economically by external circumstances. 

A lot of communist countries had food problems, but it’s a bit hasty to point solely to their socioeconomic system when there are other factors, like changing their agricultural systems dramatically on extremely short timeframes, deliberately withholding food from minorities, focusing too much on industrialization, or Mao’s stupid anti-pest policies, all of which are bad policies separate from socialism itself.",2019-11-30 01:55:22

> The Casper Solid Waste Manager, Cynthia Langston, said that though most turbine blades can be reused, there are some that are simply un-recyclable.  ""Ninety percent of the turbines are completely reclaimed, recycled, and reused, but there is ten percent that is fiberglass, so those are coming to us from three different farms in the state.""

Also...here is the only place in the source article that mentions ""hundreds of years"".  I take the following statement to read, ""We have lots of space to stack these blades and won't run out of space for hundreds of years.

> ""So Casper happens to be, I think it is, the biggest landfill facility in the state of Wyoming. These blades are really big, and they take up a lot of airspace, and our unlined area is very, very large, and it's going to last hundreds of years.""

This is stupid and misleading.

As is the case in most arguments against green power generation, there is no mention of the scale of waste or pollution associated with fossil fuel use.

So, in 20 years, there will be less than a million tons of turbine blades being disposed of. But 100 times that amount of fly ash is produced by burning coal *every year* ([75 million tons per year](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fly-ash-production-million-tonnes-year-in-different-countries-source_fig1_277309330)). Now, a good amount of that is actually used as a filler with asphalt, among other things, so [20 million tons are accounted for](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/recycling/fach01.cfm), leaving 55 million tons per year as waste, or about 76 times as much waste as those turbine blades are expected to leave in 20 years. (Corrected my arithmetic. Sorry)

So, even if retired turbine blades were simply dragged out to the desert in Arizona or Nevada, and left there, they would still have a much smaller impact than the millions of tons of fly ash produced by coal-fired power plants. This doesn't even account for the greenhouse gas production from burning coal (Two billion tons per year), or for environmental impacts from mining and transporting coal (One of the largest coal-fired plants burns [three 100-car trainloads of coal per day](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/high-cost-coal/) when running at peak capacity). When the carbon in coal is released as carbon dioxide, the material left behind is very concentrated. Fly ash contains mercury and other metals, including uranium and thorium. People who live downwind of coal-fired power plants receive radiation exposure that is higher than people living near nuclear power plants. A rough calculation by Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated that the recoverable energy from the radioactive materials in fly ash could exceed the energy generated by burning the coal in the first place.",2019-11-30 06:13:29

Jesus talks about the Father and the Holy Spirit as discrete beings, but says numerous times that ""I and My Father are one,"" and that He (Jesus) is the Word, and also the ""I Am,"" which is how God introduces himself to Moses.

The oldest of the New testament books are the letters from Paul, while the gospel of John is one of the latter books.

Still other verses maintain they are distinct persons.  Piecing all these verses together leads to this doctrine.

For example, John 1:1 describing Jesus: ""... the Word was with God, and the Word was God."".  Or when Jesus says in John 10:30 ""I and the Father are one."". See also Philippians 2:6 and Colossians 2:9.

In regards to the Holy Spirit, you have 2 Corinthians 3:17 "" Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.""  Also there is 1 Corinthians 2:10-11 (""these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.  For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."") in which the Holy Spirit is so intimate with God, he is described as God's Spirit and knows all his thoughts.

You do see all three persons of the Trinity spoken of together in verses such as 2 Corinthians 13:14 ""May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."".  Also, 1 Peter 1:2 ""...according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ..."".  See also Mark 1:10-11.

10962,f938jct,e3gqyu,Hattix,1575052602.0,29,"I wrote an article on this a while ago! Here it is.

Physicists have long understood the distinction between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. A microscopic particle, such as a neutron, an electron, a proton, and any one of numerous other particles have masses and energies so small that they're considered 'relativistic', that their mass changes substantially depending on their velocity, so we use the equivalence of mass-energy to measure them. Our unit is the Electron-Volt, the energy gained by one electron if it passes through an electrostatic field of one volt. It's a tiny amount of energy, roughly 1.6x10\^-19 joules. A typical room temperature oxygen atom, for example, has kinetic energy of around 0.025eV (speed is approximately 1,000km/h).

We measure nuclear reactions in MeV (millions of electron volts) per reaction. However, in 1991, something happened which was so odd, so strange, so outlandish that scientists at first thought their equipment was broken. While routinely collecting data on cosmic rays at the Fly's Eye (named for the large number of small telescopes used) near Salt Lake City in the US, an event happened that jarred the physicists mind almost out of its skull. They use an array of optical telescopes looking up and recording the minute blue flashes when a cosmic ray hits air molecules, from the intensity and height (gained through triangulation), they can tell a lot about a particle, such as its nature, its energy and its velocity.

In nature, there are lots of things which can accelerate particles. Black holes, relativistic jets, superdense stars, supernovae, etc. Physicists generally agree that the maximum energy one particle could have via these processes is about 10\^17 eV. Higher energy particles would interact with the intergalactic medium or even the cosmic microwave background, and scatter.

A particle at Fly's Eye that appeared to be a proton had an energy of 3.2x10\^20 eV; Any physicists among you will be gasping already. Most cosmic rays are TEN orders of magnitude weaker than that and are still among the most violent per-particle events in physics. The Large Hadron Collider plays with streams of protons at around 7 TeV, or around a hundred million times less and that energy is considered to be almost excessive.

This single proton had roughly similar energy to a professional men's tennis serve, a professional golfer's tee shot, dropping a house brick on your toe, and only ten times less than a 9mm Parabellum round! This was a single subatomic particle with enough energy to quite literally knock you off your feet. Humourously comparing it with the Higgs Boson (the 'god particle') they named this fifty-joule behemoth the 'oh my god particle'.

The energy in this one proton can hardly be understated. Using mass-energy equivalence, it had a mass of 5×10\^-13 grams, about the same as a typical bacterium. General Relativity tells us that with such incredibly high mass, it must have been travelling at a ferociously high velocity and indeed it was; 1.5 femtometres per second slower than a photon. If this particle and a beam of light had raced each other across the entire Milky Way Galaxy, the light would have won of course but the proton would have been 4.6mm behind, about half a centimetre.

The proton's velocity, within 1.467×10-15m/s of the speed of light, gave it tremendous time dialation. Relative to a rest frame, the proton was experiencing time three hundred billion times slower. At its velocity and time dialation, it would reach the edge of the visible universe in nineteen days and cross our galaxy in a mere ten seconds.

Using a simple Lorentz transformation (ratio given by the square root of one minus velocity squared over the speed of light squared) l/l0 = root(1-v\^2/v\^2) then the length contraction of the 80AU solar system out to the outer Kuiper Belt is a mere 37 metres, or about as far as you can run in five seconds. Funnily enough, the proton had around the same amount of energy as your kinetic energy running flat out.

That proton, however, couldn't travel far. It being a massive object (something that has mass) then even the weak cosmic microwave background is compressed in front of the proton (from the proton's perspective it is hugely blue-shifted, this limits distance to what is known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit, or just GZK limit) and so it wouldn't be able to travel much further than thirty million light years before interacting with something and losing its energy. That's about the distance to the Virgo Supercluster and still very much in our local universe. Something in our part of the universe spawned this particle from hell.

We can tell a lot about this little proton-that-could, including that it wouldn't be affected much at all by galactic magnetic fields, it'd be in and out far too quickly to even notice. Scientists had a good idea the direction it came form and surely something that energetic in the nearby universe wouldn't be hard to miss. Missed it was. When astronomers tracked it back, they saw nothing. Since then, many other particles, though none quite so grand, have shown up with velocities so ungodly high that the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit means they originated in the local universe, yet we see nothing there when we look.

In 2012, astronomers detected a neutrino which they called ""Big Bird"", at the IceCube detector in Antarctica. They could also narrow down its direction to a cone of approximately 20 degree diameter. Just at the edge of this cone was a ""blazar"", a super high energy active galaxy nucleus with its jets aimed straight at us, with the catchy designation of PKS B1424-418. When Big Bird was detected, this blazar was having a powerful outburst.

Neutrinos don't have the GZK limit, they don't interact with photons. This neutrino had travelled 9.5 billion light years - 2/3rds of the way across the entire observable universe! It had 2x10\^15 eV of energy, a phenomenal amount for a neutrino, but still ten thousand times smaller than the Oh My God Particle!

In 1962, a particle with approximately half the energy of the Oh My God Particle was picked up at the Volcano Ranch experiment in New Mexico. A survey at the Pierre Auger Observatory detected 27 events with arrival energies in the 10\^19 eV range between 2004 and 2007.

Some of them may be iron nuclei - they have a higher charge, so it's easier to accelerate them rapidly. The more gradual acceleration on a lower charged proton means the proton has left the magnetic field before it's reached a very high energy.",2019-11-29 18:36:42

(Those damn O'driscolls!) Well, that's how it was in real life too for a very long time. Highwaymen were a common problem in feudal Japan, as they were in many other countries at the time, and still are across substantial portions of the world. 

During the Edo Period, people started travelling a lot more. Which is probably when these myths and urban legends really started to proliferate. They stand as warnings to novice travelers to use caution and keep their wits about them. Because a baby at the side of the road, out in the middle of nowhere, could be a poor, abandoned child. Or it could be bait set by bandits hiding in the bushes over there. The latter is probably more likely.

Inside was discovered a *defixio*, or ""curse tablet"" and the archaeologist enlisted Tolkien to help translate and provide background.

The tablet, a lead sheet, was created by a man named Silvianus and called a divine curse upon someone named Senicianus for the theft of his ring. The ring itself had actually been discovered in a separate dig more than forty years earlier about 80 miles away.

Although there were certainly other influences, the cursed ring of Silvianus was one of the main inspirations for Tolkien's creation of the ring of power.

&#x200B;

The text on the defixo was:

DEVO NODENTI SILVIANVS ANILVM PERDEDIT DEMEDIAM PARTEM DONAVIT NODENTI INTER QVIBVS NOMEN SENICIANI NOLLIS PETMITTAS SANITATEM DONEC PERFERA VSQVE TEMPLVM DENTIS

Initial rat/cat invasion in the early 1800s, followed by rabbits in 1880 caused the environmental devastation that stripped the island and wiped out bird species.

When the myxomatosis virus was introduced in the 1980s, it killed most rabbits. Then hungry cats began killing wildlife directly. So they shot the cats, but since the rabbits and mice no longer had a predator, their populations rebounded. 

In 2007 Australia put $24mil into killing all the rats/rabbits and in 2014 the island was declared pest free. 

It was the largest and most successful pest eradication program **ever**.

...

Inaccuracies: 

* The birds went extinct well before the restoration plan
* The backfire was **killing** the cats, not introducing them
* The island vegetation was already being stripped bare before intervention

* Non scientific
* Over 10 years old

Knowing the prestige of the sacred band, Alexander was not content to defeat them. In route, he slaughtered them to a man. 75 couples were killed fighting for eachother.

Philip II was so appalled by this brutality that he built a monument to remember these heroic soldiers and their final battle, the Lion of Chaeronea.

Just to jump in front of debates I don't want to have. Sources contradict and historians disagree.  Maybe Alexander led the phalanx. Maybe the thebans set up the monument, not Philip II. Regardless, what makes classics so beautiful is stories like these. Sometimes you just need to pick a version of the story and roll with it. Hope y'all understand.

They cant actually teach a specific dialect because they vary so widely even among people of the same city and there are no set rules to follow when it comes to grammar or phonetics. You just speak like your parents did. Standard arabic however is very precise and detailed in all its aspects including grammar, vocabulary, phonetics, etc making it suitable for all uses where such precision is required like in official documents, formal writing, scientific articles, news broadcasts, and most types of literature. Just imagine trying to write federal laws using wild west cowboy slang and all the confusion it would cause. Now make it 10 times worse and you have arabic. That's why its important that everyone learns the standard arabic in schools. Also the standard arabic differs very little among people and times. A modern day Omani will be able to understand scripts written by a thousand year old Moroccan quite easily. If they were to meet and speak in their own dialects neither would understand a single word the other says. This unification and preservation is largely linked to the unchanging Quran which standard arabic is largely based on. To keep its interpretation constant and simple to everyone, its language must remain the official language in all arab countries and their schools. However, some argue that this is inhibiting the language from taking its natural evolutionary course and adapting to new ages and their requirements. Modern age scientific and technological texts are extremely difficult to translate into arabic and then be understood by the common arab. Using standard arabic in daily conversation is also very difficult for most and will often require more effort, longer sentences, etc so people end up using their own dialects which are much more suitable for this purpose.",2019-11-29 09:27:15

11409,f92mil4,e3bmgw,shitcloud,1575036876.0,22,"I learned how to speak Arabic at the Defense language institute. 

I was actually in one of the first groups going through the school to learn specifically Levantine Dialect (what they speak in the Levant aka Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan) rather than MSA or Modern Standard Arabic.

It helped me a lot when I went onto technical training where dialect is used a lot more. I graduated my Tech training class with honors and was quite honestly blowing some of my other coworkers out of the water with my knowledge of Dialect and all of the cultural phrases and sayings that come with it.

MSA has a lot of vowels “tooti boota loohihi” is kinda how it sounds if you don’t speak it.

Levantine has a lot of syllables, sounds like “ishtny mlik thshbgl” if you don’t understand it.

Edit: Arabic also uses a formulaic pattern that gives you a lot of flexibility and freedom in how you choose and form your words. We learned it as the tables of measures. For every word there is a three letter root (sometimes can be two but that’s a rare exception), when you take that root and apply it to a certain measure, it will change what the root word does. 
Example: د ر س (Da Ra Sa) is to study. There is a measure that changes that root to the place where you study, by adding a couple letters. م د ر س ة (Mudrisa) is a school, where as changing the emphasis in a different measure, مدرس (Muderris) is a teacher.

One of the doctors had studied in Europe and was impressed with Pasteur's germ theory, and with Joseph Lister's idea that surgery should be done in antiseptic conditions. They cleaned a room in the boat with carbolic acid for the surgery.

The operation was successful. Unfortunately, a newspaper reporter figured out what happened. Everyone denied it. The reporter's reputation was ruined.

Family summoned a doctor from Attleboro, six miles away, and neighbors kept up a death-watch at night. The fever broke after several days. The former Quaker then reported having died and received revelations from God through two archangels, and said their soul had ascended to heaven and the body had been reanimated with a new spirit charged by God with preaching his word, that of the ""Publick Universal Friend"", describing that name in the words of Isaiah 62:2 as ""a new name which the mouth of the Lord hath named"". In the 18th and 19th centuries, some writers said that the Friend did die for a brief or even extended period, while others suggested the whole illness was feigned; accounts by the doctor and other witnesses say that the illness was real but that no-one noticed the Friend die.

So what this really means is that I have at least one friend in the world. They just might be disintegrating in a coffin for the foreseeable future",2019-11-29 04:36:03

Nope.

They are developmentally disabled.  An example is that an adult with this syndrome cannot complete a 6 piece puzzle.  Average IQ is about 70.

They are lonely.  While extremely friendly, they are largely incapable of making deeper connections.

They are taken advantage of.  They cannot tell when they shouldn't comply with someone's request.

They are far more likely to have phobias than the general population.

They have physical health problems.

Since they need this social interaction that much more, a minor snub can hurt them for weeks - and since they lack actual social skills, this happens often.

For example, the claim is that one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer, but that's not remotely true if you look at the numbers. The breast cancer rate for women aged 40 is 1.53%, for women aged 70 and over it's 4.07%. The rate increase between 40 and 70, but at no point is it even close to twelve percent, 4.07% is the highest likelihood. Instead they combine the numbers for all age ranges ignoring the fact that it's not cumulative.

At 40 the chance is 1.53%, at 50 it's 2.38%, that doesn't mean that a 51-year-old woman is going to get breast cancer 3.91% of the time, she still has a 2.38% chance when she's in that age range.

It's also the case that people who have had cancer are much more likely to develop cancer again. I had a relative that developed lung cancer several times and skin cancer at least once. Her experiences aren't reflective of a random person off the street.",2019-11-29 06:11:53

It’s explained [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/07/19/201430727/what-actually-happens-at-the-end-of-trading-places ).

This was actually legal until 2010, until a US Commodity Futures Trading rule was passed in 2010, making this illegal. It’s called the “[Eddie Murphy Rule](https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/03/04/first-the-volcker-rule-now-the-eddie-murphy-rule/ ).”

And Trading Places is a great movie.

Edit: Since people are asking, and it's a little confusing, here's what happened in Trading Places with the orange juice thing. 

The Duke brothers, the villains of the show, are commodity traders, and they think they have an accurate (stolen) copy of a government report that the orange crop is going to be bad, so the price at harvest (in the future) will be high because there will be fewer oranges available than usual. So they plan to corner the market buy buying all the orange juice futures contracts they can get their hands on (basically a bet on what orange juice will sell for). 

When the Dukes start buying a lot, the other traders sense they know the price of OJ will go up, so they also start buying a lot, and the price starts to go up and up and up.

But the good guys, Valentine and Winthorpe, have stolen the real report from the Dukes and switched it with a fake report. The real report shows the crop will actually be good, and therefore the price will be low in the future. 

On the big day when the crop report is to be released, they wait until the OJ futures price is really high, and start selling like crazy. They make beaucoups money. The Dukes (the bad guys) made the opposite bet on bad information, and they lose everything.

The end",2019-11-28 23:54:00

It's the one with the Ode To Joy. It was the largest symphony ever built up to that point. The final movement of Brahms' first is practically a love poem to what symphonic musicians just call ""The Ninth"" (there are lots of ninth symphonies, but only one is The Ninth). 

Fun fact: Brahms' 1st also *literally* contains s love letter. The horns quote from a tiny song he wrote as a birthday card message (if I remember correctly) for Schumann's wife Clara, a famous musician in her own right. It's a four-líne song he wrote: Hoch auf dem Berg, Tief im Thal, Befrußt Ích dir, Viel tausrnd tausend mal (High on the mountain, deep in the valley, I greet you many thousands and thousands of times). He was rather into her. 

Anyhow, when it was pointed out to Brahms' that his first sounds a lot like Beethoven's Ninth *literally from the very first bar*, he angrily replied ""Of course it does! I know it bloody does! I wrote the damn thing"". He also bitterly complained that ""you have no idea what it's like"" to have Beethoven's shadow cast over you. He is unmatchable. He is inimitable. He is terrifying. 

I fucking love Beethoven. 

(Also he was a massive, massive, *massive* douchecanoe.)

Edit: not fixing the typos. I'm super fucking high right now. Fuck 'em.

Edit edit: I've performed for Brahms' 1st and Beethoven's Ninth, and fifth, and sixth, and the fifth piano concerto, and I've conducted The Ninth (sadly only in rehearsal). I know them all very well.

Beethoven did those things but that’s not what makes Beethoven Beethoven, noooo. Listen to Mozart and then listen to Beethoven to get a sense of the kind of spirit he put into his music. Mozart’s music is like a youthful and elegant young woman full of passion and joy and life. And it’s fucking amazing. Beethoven isn’t “better” (even though he is my favorite): his music is different. His music is like man torn down from glory and thrown into the lowliest of lows, and forced to scrap and fight: Beethoven’s music is downright ugly. It didn’t turn a blind eye to the most savage and brutal passions of human nature but expressed it directly instead. And from that chaotic hell, you can occasionally hear the hero rising to triumph, screaming and clawing his/her way to freedom and salvation. It’s a tragic and glorious story of a torn up soul fighting his/her way into freedom. Go listen to Beethoven and don’t stop until it hits you like a brick.

He explained that the nasal spray sucks germs back into the bottle which had caused the infection in my eye. He gave me a heap of samples of prescription drugs and didn't charge me for a return checkup visit. Shoutout to Dr Johnstone near I45.

>I would rather go to the theater than to a museum.

A lot of people would pass on both of these. The theater? Why didn't they say ""movies"" or something? Who goes to the theater? Also, ""museum"" can mean art or an interactive science-focused place. It's a huge category!

&#x200B;

>I find it hard to make new friends.

A lot of people over 30 have trouble making new friends. You would see huge swings based on age with this question. They often do research on undergrad students and this question is good for them but not for people generally. If you're 18-19 and you have trouble at Frosh week that's way different from a lonely 40 year old in a suburb who doesn't have nearly the same social opportunities.

It covered most of the main points of ASD which in turn made it more specific than these vague tests. 

Any indication test for any sort of psychic health issue I've ever done for funsies is way way to generalised and generous with the scores. With ASD and how it's been viewed recently it's much clearer now that it's not a gradient from minor to bad.

If you look at some of the more common symptoms and evaluate yourself compared to them and see that it hold true all the time that's a better indicator than a generalised score. With those generalised sores it's super easy to agree with a yeah sometimes on several points and get a high score.

Where as if you look at the symptoms say the ""truthiness"" aspect of things it's easier to see that it permeates my thinking much more all the time.

Sensory overload or unable to process certain stimuli is another one. It's not that I don't like to try different foods or is picky but rather those one or two where I just can't. Almost a fight or flight level reaction compared to that which I just don't like but can still eat. Or the feeling of that one piece of clothing or fabric that just shuts you down.

&#x200B;

Also while I'm more ""socially comfortable"" it has come at the expense of evaluating things from another angle where I no longer feel guilty for being me but where I'm actually less ""smooth"" compared to before when I tried in a different way.

It was the first “flagship” product of then-new Canadian Content regulations, where tv/movie/radio outlets had to include a set minimum percentage of Canadian productions. There was a points system and everything, where actors, musicians, writers, producers, etc were worth do many points.  Add them up and you had an officially Canadian show, song, movie, play, book, etc. You also got funding from the federal culture ministry’s agency. It was a mixed bag. It gave us crap like this (also watch Don Adams of Get Smart in the painful Check It Out show), and once notoriously classified Bryan Adams albums as not Canadian because he was the only one worth points.

In that paper, students in the Midwest and in California reported similar levels of life satisfaction, but the Midwesterners thought their Californian peers would be happier. The only distinguishing information the Midwestern students had when making these judgments was the fact that their hypothetical peers lived in California.

In mid 1914 Serbian army defeated vastly outnumbering Austro-Hungarian army on mountain Cer, which was first allied victory in WW1. This was suppose to be easy victory for empire, and it was seen as a slap in the face, and a huge moral boost for allies across Europe and most important - it kept large parts of their army tied up, and thus keeping them from western front. Towards end of the year, with fresh troops, A-H attacked again, and pushed Serbian army to mountains, in the process killing civilians, doing one of the worst war crimes in the war, which they documented with photographs of mass hangings (but we don't hear about that, do we?) Once again they were defeated, in the battle on the banks of river Kolubara, which was later popular example in many military schools of how great strategy is done in reality. Whole Europe was surprised first time, twice in a row - nobody expected.
But it took a toll on the army, also there were huge outbreaks of typhoid fever which devastated army. To add, Bulgarians entered war on side of AH, even though they had signed treaty (non-attack each other) previously with Serbia. They had seen their chance for some teritorial claims. All that pushed Serbian army south in 1915. They were faced with death, either in combat, or if taken prisoners, as they have seen how that works with civilians. Also, leadership was under immense pressure from GB and France (strong arming and treats of future retaliatory actions) to move army out of the country and save them, so they could open second front again and pull German troops away from west.
And that is, boys and girls, how heroes are formed. Bunch of regular, hard working people, battle hardened, pushed by forces way out of their comprehension into immpossible situation, kept fighting for chance to see their loved one. Or at least that's how great-grandpa saw it.",2019-11-28 20:54:12

After the war there was an operation to bring them to Belgrade. They were brought in by train to a secret audience with the king, and given military honors. Most returned to Albania after that as they already had many children there.

I used to work for Princess and the way the ships are laid out, you would have to be pretty dense to hear screams coming from a stateroom and think it was part of an entertainment event.  From the decks with the passenger staterooms, you literally cannot hear anything from the theaters, lounges, bars, etc.  And Emerald Princess is not a small ship.  I don’t doubt there was some mystery event occurring in a lounge on deck 6 or 7, but no sound would really carry to where the staterooms are.  The couple was in a balcony stateroom, meaning likely deck 9 or higher (if I remember correctly most of deck 8 doesn’t have balconies due to the positioning of the lifeboats, but I could be wrong).  Anyone walking down stateroom hallways and hearing screams would have to be an idiot to think it’s coming from an event on the lower decks rather than the many staterooms right next to you, because you would never have heard anything from those decks before.   It would be the equivalent of being at the movies watching a murder mystery film, and getting up and leaving, and when you walk out to the sidewalk you hear a scream outside, and think meh that must’ve come from the movie.

I agree though that in practice the word “sunken” is almost always used for something that previously sank. The confusion might be because there is an archaic usage of “sunken” as the past participle of “sink.” It definitely still has the vibe of that though. But it is not the case that sunken continents ever sank.

For those wondering why Trader Joe’s couldn’t just open Canadian locations; it’s complicated. Target, another American favourite with Canadians, couldn’t do it and failed miserably. The environment of business in Canada is different than the US.

-	Geographical distance between major centres makes logistics a nightmare
-	Official labeling laws require bilingual packaging and a specific nutritional facts panel (although there are easy ways around that; Whole Foods just slaps a label on it)
-	Real estate is expensive, especially in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver
-	Canadian shoppers have certain expectations with their favourite American chains and when they can’t be met, they’re disappointed (one of the big reasons Target Canada failed; the deals were not even close to as good as those in the US)

However. I still wish they tried. Tbh Vancouver woulda been a good pilot location considering the closest store is literally just over the border (supply chains).",2019-11-28 16:26:17

Japan's success relied heavily on surprise and ""Zerg rush"" tactics and Yamamoto knew that 6 months was all Japan could have before the Allies would recover from the shock of the attack. 

To add to that, Admiral Yamamoto had been in the USA and must have correctly calculated how long it would take for the USA to arm itself and built up sizable forces to fuck imperial Japan up.

Clean coal is an industry term for coal that has been processed through a plant. It’s different from raw coal because a lot of the coal is as fine as sand after it’s run through what we called our correct circuit) one time, and it’s what made me want to get out of the coal industry.

A chute to a stacker plugged up on our stockpile, so everything was just falling off the sides of the belt. They asked me to go up there and spray it with a water hose, but the steps to get to the chute plug were buried in about 15-20 feet of coal. I got a water hose out of our mine reclaim tunnel and started spraying and wasn’t paying attention to the soft ground below me (you’re not legally supposed to be on a stockpile, but our stockpile spilled out to the ground of the structure I was trying to climb up.)

When I got all the coal off the stairs, I had been spraying for about 10 minutes. I was going to go put the water hose back where I found it, and I couldn’t move. I was maybe 20 yards from solid ground, and it took me almost half an hour to get out. I didn’t call for anyone on the radio, cause I knew they would make fun of me. I was really scared, though.

I put my hose up, then walked back through the coal quicksand to get to the stairs, climbed the stairs, unplugged the chute to the stacker, then had to cross the coal quicksand one more time. All and all, the plant was down for over an hour on me unplugging a chute. They were not happy.",2019-11-28 16:48:58

It's for India, of course. Obviously, this kind of rule is too good for Britain itself.
